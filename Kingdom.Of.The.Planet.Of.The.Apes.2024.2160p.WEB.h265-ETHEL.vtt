1
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.125
Show off.

2
00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:46.292
Elder Luna says make
your heart still.

3
00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:48.500
The right egg will sing to you.

4
00:04:49.542 --> 00:04:52.583
Elder Luna is elder.

5
00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:14.458
Three.

6
00:05:16.208 --> 00:05:17.667
Only three.

7
00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:20.042
We take them all.

8
00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:21.542
No. Never.

9
00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:24.625
Leave one always.

10
00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:27.583
That is the law.

11
00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:31.833
Bonding day is tomorrow.

12
00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:35.875
These are yours.

13
00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:38.625
You are older.

14
00:05:38.792 --> 00:05:41.750
- By length of a sunset.
- Is older.

15
00:05:44.792 --> 00:05:45.792
Soona.

16
00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:49.167
Which one sings to you?

17
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,333
This one.

18
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,708
Silk.

19
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,958
We will raise them together.

20
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,000
Like we were raised.

21
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,542
It will be the same.

22
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,292
Yes?

23
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,958
Go, go, go.

24
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,292
- Noa!
- Noa, wait!

25
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,042
It's too far.

26
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,583
Find another way.

27
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:05,875
Noa?

28
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:08,375
No!

29
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,917
Yeah!

30
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:02,792
Noa!

31
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,417
Anaya! Soona!

32
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:08,958
Noa!

33
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,125
- Noa!
- No!

34
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,207
Do you wonder what your
bird will look like?

35
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,875
Long as it does not
look like you, Anaya.

36
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:58,125
Scared.

37
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,250
Blanket missing.

38
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,500
What is it, Noa?

39
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,583
Something in trees.

40
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,292
It's getting away.

41
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,917
Outsiders.

42
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,917
Noa scared.

43
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:53,000
Not Anaya.

44
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,917
Not ape.

45
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,375
Maybe…

46
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,750
Echo?

47
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:33,542
Echo do not come in from Valley.

48
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:35,042
Oh.

49
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,083
Were you scared?

50
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,250
Not as scared as Anaya!

51
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,792
They're back! They're back!

52
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,542
- Soona!
- Did you get your eggs?

53
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,917
- How far did you climb?
- Was it dangerous?

54
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:33,417
Very dangerous.

55
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,125
Anaya wailed like a newborn.

56
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,875
How many eggs did you honor?

57
00:11:47,042 --> 00:11:48,309
- Show us the egg.
- Did you climb well?

58
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,083
- Show us the egg.
- Show us your egg.

59
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,208
Egg. Egg. Egg.

60
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,542
Show us, Anaya, please?

61
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,667
- Who want?
- Me, me, me!

62
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:26,042
Come on. Come on.
Give, give! Hey!

63
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:27,625
Son.

64
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:37,042
Show me.

65
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,333
All must wait for bonding.

66
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,083
Even Honored Teacher.

67
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,083
I am your mother.

68
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:56,250
I knew you would climb well.

69
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,042
He waits.

70
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,625
Broken?

71
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,167
Time for that later.

72
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:21,458
Your father will want to see.

73
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:31,458
He will be proud.

74
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,125
- Noa.
- Noa.

75
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,250
Noa, didn't think
you'd make it back.

76
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,333
Too firm.

77
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,042
Yes. Yes, Koro.

78
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,833
Father. Master of Birds.

79
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:58,417
Noa.

80
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,333
Son.

81
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:13,167
Sun Eagle does not like work
for tomorrow's ceremony.

82
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,042
You climb well?

83
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,458
Above Top Nest.

84
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,708
All of you?

85
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,375
No.

86
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:24,958
Only me.

87
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,750
What that smell?

88
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,458
You did not go to
the Valley Beyond?

89
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,875
Never.

90
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:50,208
Is forbidden.

91
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,167
Yet blood of Echo
on your blanket.

92
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,542
We did not go to Valley Beyond.

93
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,125
I accept.

94
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,500
You are true, Noa.

95
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,750
Much to learn.

96
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,750
Much to teach.

97
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,500
After tomorrow's bonding.

98
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:21,292
Now, Elders must know.

99
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,500
Echoes only bring trouble.

100
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,417
Oda will chase the pests away.

101
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,917
May I seek your counsel?

102
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:50,292
This blanket had the
blood of an Echo on it.

103
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,500
Echo.

104
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,042
And I apologize for that.

105
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,333
This is a bad sign
for all of us.

106
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,625
- That smell.
- And my suggestion would be…

107
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,375
You climbed Top Nest?

108
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,083
Hard climb.

109
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,458
Ah, yes.

110
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,625
Could be dangerous.

111
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:24,833
Danger.

112
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,708
Anaya!

113
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,625
You see your father?

114
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,792
I do not understand Eagle Sun.

115
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,667
I do. He hate Noa.

116
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,208
Noa.

117
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,917
Your blanket?

118
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,208
With Elders.

119
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,042
They send Oda to
scare Echo away.

120
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:07,875
Yes, Elder.

121
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,750
When mother was small…

122
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:14,833
dry season shrank creek.

123
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,458
Echo range for food.

124
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:20,833
She saw a small and a big.

125
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,667
We have good rain.

126
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,458
Her words.

127
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:35,042
Ride true, Oda.

128
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,292
No.

129
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:18,208
Our bonding is at sunrise.

130
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,750
Master of Birds
will make exception.

131
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:24,875
They will not make him
wait for next season.

132
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,375
Yes, he will.

133
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,208
He is your father.

134
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:34,417
And I am his son.

135
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,000
Then I will wait with you.

136
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,292
Anaya wait too.

137
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,417
You cannot.

138
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,625
I must find another.

139
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,750
Noa.

140
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:46,542
Oda!

141
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:49,333
There are…

142
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,083
more.

143
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,958
What happened here?

144
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,083
Our scouts.

145
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,750
Killed by him.

146
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,125
Human.

147
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:54,250
It is her.

148
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,125
Lightning, back on your horse.

149
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:57,500
Spread out!

150
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,625
Find his clan.

151
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,542
Search in all directions!

152
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,125
The ape's horse!

153
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:12,625
Lightning, come!

154
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,792
They cannot be far.

155
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:27,542
Follow the horse! Find his clan!

156
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,750
Find human!

157
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:32,792
Ride!

158
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,083
Go, go, go!

159
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:41,833
Round them up!

160
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,583
No! No! Please!

161
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:48,875
You, prisoner!

162
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,542
Burn it down.

163
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,542
Soona! Anaya!

164
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:00,833
Noa, help!

165
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:12,458
Noa!

166
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,792
Noa!

167
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:16,125
Noa!

168
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:17,833
Noa!

169
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:20,292
Noa!

170
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:23,542
Anaya! Mother!

171
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:26,417
Where Soona?

172
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,458
They took her.

173
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,542
They broke my egg.

174
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,750
Mother.

175
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,167
Help your father!

176
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,583
No! No!

177
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:39,042
Noa!

178
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,333
No!

179
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,208
Run, Noa! Run!

180
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,125
Help your father!

181
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,125
Go, Noa! Run!

182
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:53,625
No!

183
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:59,500
He their Elder.

184
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:07,708
No!

185
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:18,125
For Caesar!

186
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,292
For Caesar!

187
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:24,958
Take them to Proximus!

188
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,083
Find the human!

189
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,417
Caesar! Caesar!

190
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,292
Caesar! Caesar!

191
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:47,292
- Father.
- Son.

192
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

193
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:51,125
Noa, free all birds.

194
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:52,583
Go.

195
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:31,708
Bend your head.

196
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,500
Noa.

197
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,125
For Caesar.

198
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:22,958
Father…

199
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:27,792
I will find them.

200
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:32,542
I will bring them home.

201
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:28,583
Mother.

202
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:40,375
Sun.

203
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,167
Come, Sun.

204
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,958
How young you are.

205
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,875
Without your mask.

206
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,458
Without this.

207
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:09,875
Speak up.

208
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:14,333
Speak up.

209
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:16,458
Not mine.

210
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,875
No mask.

211
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,333
I am not…

212
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,542
them.

213
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:27,958
Explain yourself.

214
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,500
They killed my father.

215
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,542
Stole my village.

216
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,458
I follow their tracks.

217
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:53,500
He was my village.

218
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:58,708
They killed him.

219
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,500
The Masks.

220
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,333
I am Raka.

221
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:20,500
I am Noa.

222
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:35,542
Apes falling from the sky.

223
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:45,083
He was outside
when they arrived.

224
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,125
Did you see my clan?

225
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:49,333
No.

226
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,625
I hid.

227
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:54,208
I survived.

228
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:58,750
I protected our work.

229
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:13,792
They are an ancient
way to store ideas.

230
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:21,500
The symbols have meaning.

231
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:28,667
Apes understood this meaning…

232
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,875
in the time of Caesar.

233
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:36,875
The Masks, in my village…

234
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:40,375
said that name…

235
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:43,792
"Caesar."

236
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:46,250
Shameful.

237
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:49,542
The Masks take his name.

238
00:42:51,042 --> 00:42:52,417
Twist his words.

239
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:55,042
Who is he?

240
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:56,958
Not "is."

241
00:42:58,083 --> 00:42:59,083
"Was."

242
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:06,583
Your clan does not
know the true Caesar.

243
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:11,125
Too many have
forgotten who he was.

244
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,042
I know Elders of my village.

245
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:17,917
They made the law.

246
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:19,375
That is everything.

247
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:24,083
That is not everything.

248
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:27,000
Long before your Elders…

249
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:31,417
it was Caesar who taught
us what it means to be ape.

250
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:36,042
He was our leader, our lawgiver.

251
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:38,958
Apes together strong.

252
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:41,833
Ape shall not kill ape.

253
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,750
We, the Order of Caesar…

254
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:46,667
follow his words.

255
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,292
To this day…

256
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,125
I follow.

257
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:54,083
I am now…

258
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:56,833
the last.

259
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:00,833
The work continues.

260
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,417
What is this place?

261
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:09,958
We believe apes built this…

262
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:13,667
as a refuge for humans.

263
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,708
Now it is rare to see even one.

264
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:21,167
But in Caesar's time, there
were vast herds of them.

265
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,583
Can you imagine?

266
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,542
Perhaps here, humans
were cared for, fed…

267
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,500
maybe even taught.

268
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,083
What is it?

269
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:44,125
Echo.

270
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:49,500
Human.

271
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:53,833
You have seen one?

272
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:55,833
One.

273
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,667
They are scavengers.

274
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,542
Like boars.

275
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,333
Only lesser.

276
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,125
Humans are slow-witted, but…

277
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,250
there was a time…

278
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:15,083
when humans and apes
lived side by side.

279
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,167
Yes, it is a
puzzle. I know. But…

280
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:28,333
they were important to Caesar.

281
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,667
So they are important to me.

282
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,250
I have to get to my horse.

283
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:42,083
Of course.

284
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,417
Follow me.

285
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,792
You do not know Caesar.

286
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:53,667
You do not know books.

287
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,667
You should stay here.

288
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:02,292
There is much I could teach you.

289
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,250
Go away!

290
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:12,792
No! Come back!

291
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:13,792
Pest!

292
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:16,083
Wait! Come back!

293
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,875
There is no danger.

294
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,917
That is the one.

295
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:25,500
Stole from my village.

296
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:30,292
She follows you
from your village?

297
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,750
Perhaps Caesar bids me travel.

298
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,500
Wait here. The work continues.

299
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:46,833
I have no time for…

300
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,167
I will not slow you down.
I, too, keep a horse.

301
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:00,167
Can we not slow down?

302
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,333
No.

303
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,458
I am sure she follows.

304
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:07,958
I do not know why.

305
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:16,375
A beautiful bird!

306
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:20,125
Eagle Sun.

307
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:22,667
My father's bird.

308
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:25,708
He follows to taunt me.

309
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:30,750
This bird follows you too?

310
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:35,208
We raise eagles, my clan.

311
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:37,000
Sing to them…

312
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,375
so they know us.

313
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:40,708
A bond.

314
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:44,208
Sing the song.

315
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:46,375
Please.

316
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:50,708
No.

317
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:54,667
My father was Master of Birds.

318
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,333
He sang to eagles.

319
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,500
But I am not him.

320
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:03,458
Shame.

321
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:07,917
I would have enjoyed a song.

322
00:48:30,042 --> 00:48:31,542
Strange weapons.

323
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:33,875
Broken.

324
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,333
Raka.

325
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Noa.

326
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:22,292
She follows because
she is hungry.

327
00:49:31,042 --> 00:49:32,542
No, no, no.

328
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:36,208
This is…

329
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:39,625
important.

330
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:43,333
They get cold.

331
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,083
Show mercy.

332
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:12,458
She is smarter than most.

333
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,333
We will name her Nova.

334
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,375
We name them all Nova.

335
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:30,417
I do not know why. It
is from Caesar's time.

336
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:36,208
Why did Caesar care
so much for Echoes?

337
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:41,417
Legend says he was
reared by them…

338
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:45,417
impossible as that may seem.

339
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,125
Caesar legend is important.

340
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:53,542
He was first Elder.

341
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:57,958
He led with decency…

342
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:00,667
morality…

343
00:51:02,417 --> 00:51:03,792
strength…

344
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:08,292
compassion.

345
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:16,333
Caesar never had to share camp…

346
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:19,750
with this Nova.

347
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:33,917
The smell is potent.

348
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:32,667
A tunnel that eats light?

349
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:35,833
She saw what I saw.

350
00:54:36,917 --> 00:54:38,500
It was in her eyes.

351
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:39,875
She…

352
00:54:40,917 --> 00:54:42,208
reacted.

353
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:44,375
How?

354
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,667
As ape would.

355
00:54:57,417 --> 00:54:58,917
If Echo comes, she must ride.

356
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:04,042
Is my young companion showing
compassion for our fellow traveler?

357
00:55:05,042 --> 00:55:06,250
She is slow.

358
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:25,792
Horse.

359
00:55:34,917 --> 00:55:38,292
Then, of course,
there is the gibbon.

360
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:40,875
Very, very long arms.

361
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:47,208
Is most unfortunate that the human
can only use its feet for walking.

362
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:50,792
Imagine if you were
falling from a tree.

363
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:53,500
You only have two appendages
to save your life.

364
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:56,958
But if you were able to
use both of your hands…

365
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:59,083
and both of your feet…

366
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,583
that's four times the safety.

367
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:06,625
And I imagine that, if
I came across a special…

368
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,000
What is that?

369
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:39,917
Horses with stripes.

370
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:44,208
Quite striking.

371
00:57:32,542 --> 00:57:36,792
We feared the herds
ceased to exist.

372
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:02,750
Will you not say goodbye?

373
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:08,208
I must find my clan.

374
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:12,625
The Nova stays with her kind.

375
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:15,458
You raise them up.

376
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:20,708
Follow Caesar's word.

377
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:32,125
To remember…

378
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:35,292
who he was.

379
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:41,167
It is important.

380
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:12,792
They are like you.

381
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,458
Would you like to join them?

382
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
He has his journey.

383
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:39,958
We have ours.

384
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:41,583
Come.

385
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:31,083
Nova!

386
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:33,292
Nova!

387
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:01,125
Take them!

388
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:08,708
Ride them down!

389
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:10,750
Catch that one!

390
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,625
This one?

391
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:02,667
There!

392
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:25,792
Spread out.

393
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:27,125
Lightning.

394
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:40,958
This way.

395
01:02:41,917 --> 01:02:42,917
Find her!

396
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:53,917
I know she here!

397
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,083
Raka!

398
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,083
Nova!

399
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:05,167
Come out!

400
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:07,042
I smell you!

401
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,542
Raka!

402
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:18,083
Noa!

403
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,208
Noa!

404
01:04:18,042 --> 01:04:19,125
Raka!

405
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:23,167
Caesar will forgive.

406
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:25,625
Shall we continue?

407
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:49,292
This should give us time.

408
01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:29,542
What did I miss?

409
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:31,167
She spoke.

410
01:05:34,042 --> 01:05:36,375
She called my name.

411
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:38,875
You misheard.

412
01:05:39,042 --> 01:05:43,708
You said this Nova
was smarter than most.

413
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:45,333
Within reason.

414
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,750
Some intelligence,
to be sure, but…

415
01:05:48,917 --> 01:05:50,458
I have a name.

416
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:53,375
Mae.

417
01:05:57,792 --> 01:06:00,000
I know where they're
taking your clan.

418
01:06:09,375 --> 01:06:10,958
It's a human settlement.

419
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:14,250
It's where I'm headed to.

420
01:06:14,875 --> 01:06:16,542
Looking for more like me.

421
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:18,167
There are more…

422
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:20,167
like you?

423
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:24,458
There used to be more.

424
01:06:25,292 --> 01:06:28,333
You hid the truth?

425
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,708
My mother taught me silence…

426
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:33,833
for my safety.

427
01:06:34,583 --> 01:06:37,583
You were safe with us.

428
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:40,875
And still not true.

429
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:44,583
Where is your mother now?

430
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:49,833
I am alone.

431
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:56,375
As are we all.

432
01:06:57,583 --> 01:06:58,833
But now…

433
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:02,792
we have each other.

434
01:07:16,917 --> 01:07:18,917
Let us have a fire.

435
01:07:19,083 --> 01:07:21,500
We have much to discuss.

436
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:50,000
Go back.

437
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:51,958
Go back!

438
01:10:58,458 --> 01:10:59,458
Noa!

439
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:04,083
Mae!

440
01:11:09,542 --> 01:11:10,542
Mae!

441
01:11:10,917 --> 01:11:11,917
No!

442
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:27,958
Mae!

443
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,375
Hold on!

444
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,583
Mae!

445
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:52,333
No! Raka!

446
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,500
Raka!

447
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:08,917
Together…

448
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:11,250
strong.

449
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,083
Stand back! Human!

450
01:14:33,792 --> 01:14:35,042
No! No! No!

451
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,917
Welcome home, baby bird.

452
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:03,458
Go!

453
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:57,792
Noa!

454
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:04,250
I missed you. Soona. Soona.

455
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:08,625
No.

456
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,458
You were dead.

457
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:17,083
I saw you fall.

458
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:19,875
You are not hurt?

459
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:22,083
No.

460
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:23,833
No.

461
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:30,958
Mother?

462
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:32,125
Anaya?

463
01:17:23,667 --> 01:17:24,833
Vonnegut.

464
01:17:25,917 --> 01:17:27,375
That's a good one.

465
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:30,250
Not a lot of fiction there.

466
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:33,875
He's mostly
interested in history.

467
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:37,875
Roman history, especially.

468
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:44,875
The name's Trevathan.

469
01:17:50,292 --> 01:17:51,625
Where are you from?

470
01:17:54,667 --> 01:17:55,917
You first.

471
01:17:57,917 --> 01:18:01,667
Well, doesn't really
matter, does it?

472
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:03,042
I left.

473
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:06,125
Same as you.

474
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:08,875
Made it almost to the coast…

475
01:18:09,042 --> 01:18:12,125
and then I fell and
shattered my ankles.

476
01:18:12,292 --> 01:18:14,167
That's where Proximus found me.

477
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,375
And now you read
him Roman history.

478
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:25,542
So, who are you?

479
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:29,917
I'm the human not
helping the apes.

480
01:18:46,042 --> 01:18:47,500
Noa.

481
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:51,750
Share. Must share.

482
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:52,917
Good.

483
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Noa?

484
01:18:58,417 --> 01:18:59,667
- Noa!
- You're alive!

485
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:18,583
Father…

486
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:20,417
he's…

487
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:22,875
I know.

488
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,042
We must go.

489
01:19:43,583 --> 01:19:44,833
Come.

490
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,250
Caesar!

491
01:20:03,292 --> 01:20:09,042
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

492
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:55,917
What a wonderful day!

493
01:20:56,625 --> 01:20:58,625
What a wonderful day!

494
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:03,500
Are we thankful for
the words of Caesar?

495
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:05,542
We are thankful.

496
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:07,792
Do we bend our heads?

497
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:09,833
We bend!

498
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:12,167
Say his words!

499
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:14,375
Apes together strong!

500
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:16,208
Say his words!

501
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:18,708
Apes together strong!

502
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:21,583
What a wonderful day!

503
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:32,583
That felt good.

504
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:36,042
When I think on those words…

505
01:21:36,208 --> 01:21:39,125
I feel good.

506
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:44,792
Caesar was first Elder.

507
01:21:44,958 --> 01:21:48,958
Now I am Caesar.

508
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:54,208
He is not Caesar.

509
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:57,833
Careful, son. We are his now.

510
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:08,167
Now, when I think of all the
treasures left inside for us…

511
01:22:10,042 --> 01:22:13,000
I feel very good.

512
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:18,000
It may be difficult to open.

513
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:20,583
But not impossible…

514
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:23,667
because we work together.

515
01:22:24,708 --> 01:22:27,083
All as one.

516
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:29,167
As Caesar wanted.

517
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:32,292
As Caesar required.

518
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:35,125
Apes together strong!

519
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Pull!

520
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:49,500
Pull!

521
01:22:50,542 --> 01:22:52,500
Pull! More!

522
01:22:58,750 --> 01:22:59,875
Watch this.

523
01:23:13,042 --> 01:23:14,708
- Pull!
- Pull!

524
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:16,917
Pull!

525
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:23,292
Yes!

526
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,083
Yes!

527
01:23:30,667 --> 01:23:32,500
More!

528
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:45,292
Enough!

529
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:54,750
Maybe stronger tomorrow.

530
01:24:14,292 --> 01:24:15,708
Don't worry.

531
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:18,208
Whoever's in there is
either dead or gone.

532
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:22,792
We've been bangin' on
that door for months.

533
01:24:25,875 --> 01:24:27,667
Do you not know where we are?

534
01:24:28,292 --> 01:24:31,583
When things got bad and the
government went underground…

535
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,625
this is where half of it went.

536
01:24:33,792 --> 01:24:36,958
With all their technology,
and all their weapons…

537
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:40,708
Don't you understand?

538
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:43,875
That ape cannot have
what is inside the…

539
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:47,167
You gotta stop thinking
about the way things were…

540
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,625
and start thinking
about the way they are.

541
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:51,708
This is a good life…

542
01:24:51,875 --> 01:24:54,250
and you have a chance
to be a part of it.

543
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:57,208
What, and build a
world for the apes?

544
01:24:57,375 --> 01:25:00,167
It is already their world.

545
01:25:08,292 --> 01:25:11,250
There's hot water and fresh
clothes in that room back there.

546
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:15,583
You'll feel better when you
get yourself cleaned up.

547
01:25:17,167 --> 01:25:19,625
You better figure out how
to be useful around here.

548
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:27,833
Honored Elder…

549
01:25:28,917 --> 01:25:29,917
had to bend.

550
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:34,083
We had no choice.

551
01:25:35,917 --> 01:25:37,458
You must accept.

552
01:25:40,792 --> 01:25:41,958
It is law.

553
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:49,208
The Elders did not
tell us everything…

554
01:25:49,375 --> 01:25:51,417
about this world.

555
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:56,000
They did not tell us
because they did not know.

556
01:25:57,292 --> 01:26:00,417
They did not want to know.

557
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:08,458
You are different.

558
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:13,542
Come.

559
01:26:28,667 --> 01:26:31,042
And that's why they
call it a toga party.

560
01:26:34,333 --> 01:26:38,292
You are a funny little
human, Trevathan.

561
01:26:43,708 --> 01:26:44,917
Hey, come.

562
01:26:45,542 --> 01:26:46,583
Come, sit.

563
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:49,458
Please.

564
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:52,958
Go.

565
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:54,667
Go.

566
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:07,708
Wonderful day, yes?

567
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:14,292
You two have come a long way.

568
01:27:16,292 --> 01:27:18,583
An ape and a human…

569
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:20,375
traveling together is…

570
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,417
quite an adventure.

571
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:27,625
You are Noa, yes?

572
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:30,458
Welcome, Noa.

573
01:27:45,625 --> 01:27:46,625
Go.

574
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,458
Mae…

575
01:27:55,625 --> 01:27:59,250
you are familiar
with the concept of…

576
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:01,667
evolution?

577
01:28:01,833 --> 01:28:04,375
That is the human label, yeah?

578
01:28:04,542 --> 01:28:09,000
The advancement that
I crave requires time.

579
01:28:09,167 --> 01:28:13,042
Vast amounts of time
that I do not have.

580
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:17,583
Unfortunately, I am
but a mortal ape.

581
01:28:19,833 --> 01:28:24,833
So this is why I need to get
the knowledge inside that vault.

582
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,292
I believe it will deliver…

583
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:29,708
instant evolution.

584
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:32,875
Noa.

585
01:28:33,917 --> 01:28:35,250
You don't understand.

586
01:28:36,667 --> 01:28:38,083
In their time…

587
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:43,875
humans were capable of
many great things, yes?

588
01:28:44,042 --> 01:28:46,292
They could level mountains.

589
01:28:48,083 --> 01:28:50,500
They could speak across oceans.

590
01:28:50,667 --> 01:28:53,250
They could fly, Noa.

591
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:55,625
Like eagles fly.

592
01:28:55,792 --> 01:28:58,875
But now, we will learn.

593
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:02,542
Apes will learn. I
will learn, yeah…

594
01:29:02,708 --> 01:29:05,583
from what is inside that vault.

595
01:29:06,917 --> 01:29:08,167
It's Impossible.

596
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:11,292
No one's getting in there.

597
01:29:16,917 --> 01:29:19,125
Mae, Mae, Mae, Mae.

598
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:26,625
My apes encountered
your companions.

599
01:29:27,792 --> 01:29:31,167
I believe this map
belonged to you.

600
01:29:31,792 --> 01:29:33,292
You see, Noa…

601
01:29:33,833 --> 01:29:36,250
before she was
traveling with you…

602
01:29:36,417 --> 01:29:40,500
and that old orangutan…

603
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:43,917
Mae was with other humans.

604
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:48,208
But sadly…

605
01:29:50,042 --> 01:29:53,542
my apes did not
realize their value…

606
01:29:53,708 --> 01:29:57,333
so I was brought only bodies.

607
01:29:58,208 --> 01:30:02,625
I could not speak to them
like I can speak to you.

608
01:30:04,542 --> 01:30:05,542
I know…

609
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:10,042
you are coming here to
get inside my vault.

610
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:11,833
It is not yours!

611
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:16,042
It is now, isn't it?

612
01:30:17,042 --> 01:30:19,375
And I will get inside.

613
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:24,583
No matter how many
apes it costs me.

614
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:26,458
Noa.

615
01:30:28,708 --> 01:30:33,708
I have heard that you are
a very clever ape, yeah?

616
01:30:34,667 --> 01:30:35,667
Very clever.

617
01:30:35,833 --> 01:30:39,875
He repaired one of your
broken staffs, Trevathan.

618
01:30:42,792 --> 01:30:46,542
I have much use for clever apes.

619
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:49,250
Now, can you tell me…

620
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:55,125
did Mae tell you how
to get inside my vault?

621
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,917
She told me nothing.

622
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:04,500
Told you nothing!

623
01:31:04,667 --> 01:31:05,667
Nothing.

624
01:31:09,458 --> 01:31:11,333
Told you nothing.

625
01:31:15,542 --> 01:31:16,583
Noa.

626
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:19,583
Come. Come with me.

627
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:20,917
Come, come.

628
01:31:22,417 --> 01:31:24,000
I have something to show you.

629
01:31:25,042 --> 01:31:27,000
Come. Come.

630
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:29,958
Come, Noa.

631
01:31:31,625 --> 01:31:33,708
Tell me, what do you see?

632
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:45,458
Stolen clans.

633
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:49,500
Not clans.

634
01:31:51,375 --> 01:31:52,458
A kingdom.

635
01:31:54,042 --> 01:31:57,750
Noa, a kingdom for apes.

636
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:05,708
Humans can never be trusted.

637
01:32:06,417 --> 01:32:09,083
Where there are
two that can speak…

638
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:11,083
there must be more.

639
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:18,958
Mae has come here to claim
the tools inside my vault.

640
01:32:19,125 --> 01:32:22,292
Tools that make humans strong…

641
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:24,542
and make them dangerous.

642
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:29,250
That is why I must
have them first.

643
01:32:29,417 --> 01:32:30,625
Yeah?

644
01:32:30,792 --> 01:32:35,833
They do not understand
that this is our time.

645
01:32:36,375 --> 01:32:38,500
This is my kingdom.

646
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:44,875
I must destroy their kind.

647
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,458
Unless we want to
live in cages again.

648
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:57,667
Come.

649
01:32:57,833 --> 01:32:59,333
Come, Noa.

650
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,833
Let us eat.

651
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:03,875
Trevathan!

652
01:33:04,417 --> 01:33:05,917
Tell us a story.

653
01:33:06,417 --> 01:33:08,125
Make it a funny one.

654
01:33:31,125 --> 01:33:33,000
They will not come.

655
01:33:36,792 --> 01:33:37,792
Why?

656
01:33:39,708 --> 01:33:42,125
Because Eagle Clan…

657
01:33:44,042 --> 01:33:45,125
is gone.

658
01:33:48,417 --> 01:33:53,500
Eagle Clan is here.

659
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:57,042
We are here.

660
01:33:59,542 --> 01:34:01,500
In land of Proximus.

661
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:08,208
And Proximus has
no need for eagles.

662
01:34:42,625 --> 01:34:46,458
You come to judge me?

663
01:34:51,875 --> 01:34:53,708
I judge myself.

664
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,292
I promised our father…

665
01:34:59,458 --> 01:35:01,042
I would bring them home.

666
01:35:05,458 --> 01:35:06,708
I failed.

667
01:35:08,958 --> 01:35:11,417
Eagle Clan belongs…

668
01:35:11,583 --> 01:35:15,625
to Proximus Caesar now.

669
01:35:19,292 --> 01:35:21,875
That is the law.

670
01:35:37,292 --> 01:35:42,000
But the law is wrong.

671
01:36:29,792 --> 01:36:32,500
Time for the evening lesson.

672
01:36:32,667 --> 01:36:35,583
It would be very good
for you to be there.

673
01:37:14,583 --> 01:37:17,250
You did not come for Echoes.

674
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:21,833
And you were not alone.

675
01:37:23,125 --> 01:37:24,208
I'm sorry.

676
01:37:26,792 --> 01:37:29,208
Proximus's apes found our camp.

677
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:33,417
They killed everyone.

678
01:37:34,792 --> 01:37:36,750
I barely escaped.

679
01:37:37,667 --> 01:37:39,458
I needed your help.

680
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:43,083
- And I was afraid.
- The more you speak…

681
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:45,250
the less I believe.

682
01:37:45,417 --> 01:37:47,333
I was wrong not to trust you.

683
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,500
And I know that now.

684
01:37:48,667 --> 01:37:51,792
I trust you only
to help yourself.

685
01:37:54,167 --> 01:37:56,625
But that could help me now.

686
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:02,417
I have questions.

687
01:38:03,792 --> 01:38:05,333
You answer true…

688
01:38:06,167 --> 01:38:07,542
maybe I help.

689
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:13,083
What do you need inside vault?

690
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:16,500
It's…

691
01:38:17,417 --> 01:38:18,625
like a book.

692
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,167
- A special book.
- How?

693
01:38:22,667 --> 01:38:23,667
Special?

694
01:38:25,042 --> 01:38:27,792
Humans lost their
ability to speak.

695
01:38:27,958 --> 01:38:29,708
And this book might
bring it back.

696
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:33,167
A book can do this?

697
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,250
This one can.

698
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:47,250
Raka said apes and humans…

699
01:38:48,583 --> 01:38:50,208
lived side by side.

700
01:38:52,833 --> 01:38:54,167
True or not true?

701
01:38:57,292 --> 01:38:58,458
Apes were silent.

702
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:01,417
Like the Echo.

703
01:39:03,083 --> 01:39:04,667
Humans were dominant.

704
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:07,542
The virus spread…

705
01:39:08,792 --> 01:39:10,250
that we created.

706
01:39:11,292 --> 01:39:12,917
It made apes smarter.

707
01:39:14,292 --> 01:39:16,292
And it almost killed all of us.

708
01:39:23,167 --> 01:39:25,875
You know a way inside, yes?

709
01:39:27,542 --> 01:39:28,542
Yes.

710
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:31,917
One last question.

711
01:39:35,083 --> 01:39:39,333
Will water destroy
what is inside?

712
01:39:59,792 --> 01:40:00,792
Noa.

713
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:06,042
I need your help.

714
01:40:07,792 --> 01:40:09,625
What help?

715
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:15,833
A climb.

716
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,500
One I cannot do alone.

717
01:40:19,667 --> 01:40:20,667
Why?

718
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,750
To free our clan.

719
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:49,583
Anaya scared.

720
01:41:24,958 --> 01:41:27,250
Soona, this is Mae.

721
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:30,792
Hello, Soona.

722
01:41:35,292 --> 01:41:36,625
What do we do?

723
01:41:38,708 --> 01:41:40,208
We're gonna need all of this.

724
01:41:41,208 --> 01:41:42,375
Follow me.

725
01:41:56,083 --> 01:41:57,250
Careful.

726
01:42:00,208 --> 01:42:04,083
The power runs through, yes?

727
01:42:06,417 --> 01:42:07,417
Yes.

728
01:42:23,833 --> 01:42:27,417
You cannot make hard climb…

729
01:42:30,292 --> 01:42:31,792
without Anaya.

730
01:42:45,833 --> 01:42:47,000
Hello, Echo.

731
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:05,333
This burns hot.

732
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:07,375
But under pressure…

733
01:43:08,792 --> 01:43:10,833
it will explode.

734
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:14,167
How do you know this?

735
01:43:20,667 --> 01:43:21,875
Oh, shit.

736
01:43:27,208 --> 01:43:28,208
"Shit"?

737
01:43:29,417 --> 01:43:31,542
- Take that over there.
- Okay.

738
01:43:31,708 --> 01:43:33,625
I go with Anaya.

739
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:35,792
Safer that way.

740
01:43:37,167 --> 01:43:40,208
Anaya! Anaya. Stop.

741
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:41,958
You're doing it wrong.

742
01:43:42,125 --> 01:43:42,958
Okay.

743
01:43:43,125 --> 01:43:44,250
You like her.

744
01:43:46,917 --> 01:43:47,917
Soona.

745
01:43:49,875 --> 01:43:51,792
We were born within a sunset.

746
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:56,667
No. Anaya…

747
01:43:56,833 --> 01:43:58,583
He's just going to rebuild it.

748
01:44:10,292 --> 01:44:11,292
You…

749
01:44:13,958 --> 01:44:15,583
You had an opportunity.

750
01:44:16,125 --> 01:44:18,417
I gave you an opportunity.

751
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:23,625
But you're fantasizing about a
past that can never come back.

752
01:44:30,167 --> 01:44:31,542
Listen to me.

753
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,417
Trevathan, you
don't belong here.

754
01:44:38,917 --> 01:44:41,083
You think it's over…

755
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:42,500
but it's not.

756
01:44:43,917 --> 01:44:47,917
Nobody is going to blame
you for what happened here.

757
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:52,792
Just come with us.

758
01:44:55,583 --> 01:44:56,583
Please?

759
01:45:04,208 --> 01:45:06,625
He's gonna skin
your monkey alive.

760
01:45:11,167 --> 01:45:12,167
And you…

761
01:45:13,333 --> 01:45:14,333
Well…

762
01:45:16,417 --> 01:45:18,250
you're gonna learn.

763
01:45:26,208 --> 01:45:27,208
Oh, no.

764
01:45:27,417 --> 01:45:28,500
Please!

765
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,833
We need to go.

766
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,250
It'll be light soon.

767
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:55,083
You said there would be climb!

768
01:47:09,417 --> 01:47:10,458
Mae, wait!

769
01:47:17,958 --> 01:47:19,292
Mae!

770
01:47:23,417 --> 01:47:24,417
There!

771
01:47:25,375 --> 01:47:27,208
We need to go up there.

772
01:47:29,083 --> 01:47:30,833
Now we climb?

773
01:47:52,042 --> 01:47:53,375
Easier than Top Nest.

774
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,167
Keep climbing.

775
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:20,875
Noa!

776
01:48:33,875 --> 01:48:34,875
Shit?

777
01:48:36,125 --> 01:48:37,125
Mm-hmm.

778
01:49:40,792 --> 01:49:41,958
Wait. Careful.

779
01:49:47,167 --> 01:49:48,167
Oops.

780
01:49:48,958 --> 01:49:50,083
Anaya!

781
01:50:19,375 --> 01:50:23,083
Noa, what is this place?

782
01:50:25,625 --> 01:50:26,708
It smells.

783
01:50:36,125 --> 01:50:37,458
What is that? Noa!

784
01:50:38,458 --> 01:50:39,958
Noa! What happening?

785
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:17,292
Echo build all this?

786
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:42,292
Wait here.

787
01:52:35,375 --> 01:52:36,500
Mama!

788
01:53:50,250 --> 01:53:53,458
The symbols have meaning.

789
01:54:46,875 --> 01:54:48,292
Time to go.

790
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,375
Whoa. What are they?

791
01:55:17,667 --> 01:55:18,667
Come!

792
01:55:57,625 --> 01:55:59,083
We'll have to move fast.

793
01:55:59,750 --> 01:56:00,917
You go to your clan…

794
01:56:01,417 --> 01:56:02,958
and I'll trigger the explosion.

795
01:56:58,208 --> 01:57:03,333
Noa, you are a very useful ape.

796
01:57:04,625 --> 01:57:08,625
You understand so many things.

797
01:57:08,792 --> 01:57:11,375
And yet, you fail to observe…

798
01:57:11,542 --> 01:57:14,708
one of the most important.

799
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:19,417
You cannot trust a human!

800
01:57:21,042 --> 01:57:24,750
Here comes your clan
to bear witness.

801
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,292
You may be fool enough…

802
01:57:30,458 --> 01:57:34,667
to put your faith in such
a duplicitous creature.

803
01:57:37,250 --> 01:57:38,417
But I am not.

804
01:57:46,542 --> 01:57:47,750
Tell me, Noa…

805
01:57:48,542 --> 01:57:50,458
ape to ape…

806
01:57:52,250 --> 01:57:56,875
what did Mae have planned
for me inside my own vault?

807
01:57:59,542 --> 01:58:00,542
Okay.

808
01:58:01,042 --> 01:58:03,875
So what do you choose?

809
01:58:04,292 --> 01:58:07,417
A human over an ape?

810
01:58:08,458 --> 01:58:11,917
Your sweet little Soona…

811
01:58:13,708 --> 01:58:16,167
or that stinky human?

812
01:58:17,292 --> 01:58:18,500
Tell me your plan!

813
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:21,875
No!

814
01:58:58,625 --> 01:58:59,958
I see.

815
01:59:02,083 --> 01:59:04,625
You can leave, Mae.

816
01:59:06,167 --> 01:59:07,250
You can go.

817
01:59:07,708 --> 01:59:10,000
You're free. Just tell me…

818
01:59:10,958 --> 01:59:15,667
are there more of
those in there?

819
01:59:22,125 --> 01:59:23,250
Mae?

820
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:25,542
Mae.

821
01:59:27,375 --> 01:59:28,375
No.

822
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:31,667
We cannot.

823
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,125
He can't have it.

824
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,750
Mae.

825
01:59:37,458 --> 01:59:38,750
- I'm sorry.
- Mae!

826
01:59:40,042 --> 01:59:41,083
No!

827
01:59:42,708 --> 01:59:43,958
Mae, no!

828
01:59:46,167 --> 01:59:47,375
Mae!

829
02:00:11,792 --> 02:00:13,208
What have you done?

830
02:00:19,958 --> 02:00:21,250
Climb.

831
02:00:21,417 --> 02:00:22,417
Climb!

832
02:00:23,375 --> 02:00:24,667
- Climb!
- No.

833
02:00:30,250 --> 02:00:31,250
No!

834
02:01:14,875 --> 02:01:16,583
Noa! Noa!

835
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:18,750
- Soona!
- Behind you!

836
02:01:19,208 --> 02:01:21,000
Climb!

837
02:01:22,417 --> 02:01:24,042
Son! Son!

838
02:01:24,208 --> 02:01:25,375
- Mother!
- Son!

839
02:01:25,833 --> 02:01:27,542
Mother! Mother!

840
02:01:27,792 --> 02:01:28,792
Mother!

841
02:01:30,583 --> 02:01:31,583
Dar!

842
02:01:31,625 --> 02:01:33,125
Grab her!

843
02:01:33,417 --> 02:01:35,542
Dar! Grab my hand!

844
02:01:35,708 --> 02:01:38,542
- Mother!
- Dar!

845
02:01:41,833 --> 02:01:42,833
Dar!

846
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:47,833
Dar, got you.

847
02:01:48,958 --> 02:01:50,583
Noa, what we do?

848
02:01:52,583 --> 02:01:54,458
This way! Go!

849
02:02:02,042 --> 02:02:05,125
Eagle Clan! Climb!

850
02:02:05,292 --> 02:02:07,542
Follow Soona! Follow Anaya!

851
02:02:07,708 --> 02:02:09,833
- This way! Climb!
- Go. Go.

852
02:02:10,292 --> 02:02:11,292
Climb!

853
02:02:19,375 --> 02:02:20,458
This way!

854
02:02:22,208 --> 02:02:23,333
Hurry!

855
02:02:25,042 --> 02:02:26,083
Follow Soona!

856
02:02:26,542 --> 02:02:28,458
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Go!

857
02:02:33,208 --> 02:02:34,042
Come.

858
02:02:34,208 --> 02:02:35,250
Go!

859
02:02:35,417 --> 02:02:36,500
Climb, Soona!

860
02:02:36,667 --> 02:02:38,208
This the way out!

861
02:02:38,708 --> 02:02:39,875
Hurry!

862
02:02:40,250 --> 02:02:41,250
- Climb!
- Noa!

863
02:02:41,417 --> 02:02:42,542
Mother, go!

864
02:02:42,708 --> 02:02:44,208
- Noa!
- Climb, Anaya!

865
02:02:44,375 --> 02:02:45,667
- Soona, go!
- Lead them!

866
02:02:45,833 --> 02:02:47,292
Go! Climb!

867
02:02:47,458 --> 02:02:48,458
Go!

868
02:02:48,583 --> 02:02:50,083
Go, hurry!

869
02:05:34,708 --> 02:05:37,792
You think you can
destroy my kingdom?

870
02:05:47,750 --> 02:05:51,333
You think you can
destroy what I am?

871
02:05:57,167 --> 02:05:58,167
- Noa!
- Leave him.

872
02:06:11,708 --> 02:06:13,125
Noa.

873
02:06:14,792 --> 02:06:18,708
You showed so much promise.

874
02:06:20,458 --> 02:06:23,208
You are going to stand…

875
02:06:23,875 --> 02:06:27,125
so that you can
bend for your king…

876
02:06:27,917 --> 02:06:29,125
before you die.

877
02:06:34,292 --> 02:06:38,292
And you will all bear witness…

878
02:06:38,458 --> 02:06:43,917
as Noa bends before his king.

879
02:06:47,625 --> 02:06:49,000
Now stand.

880
02:06:49,958 --> 02:06:51,583
Stand now!

881
02:06:54,833 --> 02:06:55,833
That's it.

882
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:57,917
Clever ape.

883
02:07:21,833 --> 02:07:23,333
What is this?

884
02:07:26,667 --> 02:07:28,500
Trevathan would love this.

885
02:07:58,958 --> 02:07:59,958
Enough!

886
02:08:02,417 --> 02:08:03,417
Enough!

887
02:09:13,333 --> 02:09:17,292
Let us go home.

888
02:09:47,958 --> 02:09:49,167
He's coming!

889
02:09:52,583 --> 02:09:53,750
Soft?

890
02:09:54,458 --> 02:09:56,333
Too firm.

891
02:09:57,167 --> 02:09:58,167
Too firm.

892
02:09:59,917 --> 02:10:01,375
- Silk.
- Good.

893
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Noa.

894
02:10:30,667 --> 02:10:32,292
I came to say goodbye.

895
02:10:41,542 --> 02:10:43,542
Proximus was right.

896
02:10:44,667 --> 02:10:48,458
Humans will never give up.

897
02:10:49,708 --> 02:10:53,625
Not until you claim all things…

898
02:10:53,792 --> 02:10:55,333
for yourselves.

899
02:10:56,417 --> 02:10:57,792
It was ours.

900
02:10:58,625 --> 02:11:01,083
That silo was a human place…

901
02:11:01,250 --> 02:11:03,042
with human things
and human ideas.

902
02:11:03,208 --> 02:11:04,708
It was not meant for apes.

903
02:11:04,875 --> 02:11:07,500
What is for apes?

904
02:11:09,583 --> 02:11:11,708
Should we go back to silence?

905
02:11:13,708 --> 02:11:16,250
We will rebuild our home.

906
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,167
Better.

907
02:11:19,667 --> 02:11:20,875
Stronger.

908
02:11:21,833 --> 02:11:24,125
From what we have learned.

909
02:11:34,375 --> 02:11:36,625
If Raka were here…

910
02:11:38,083 --> 02:11:40,542
he would tell us his Caesar…

911
02:11:41,458 --> 02:11:43,417
had much to say on this.

912
02:11:48,292 --> 02:11:50,625
Was he right?

913
02:11:57,042 --> 02:12:02,792
Can ape and human live together?

914
02:12:13,792 --> 02:12:15,125
I don't know.

915
02:12:29,333 --> 02:12:31,375
Important.

916
02:13:20,375 --> 02:13:22,042
See you soon.

917
02:14:39,417 --> 02:14:40,417
Come.

918
02:14:46,125 --> 02:14:47,750
Rescaling back down to 20.

919
02:14:48,042 --> 02:14:50,292
New latitude point, 2.722.

920
02:14:50,458 --> 02:14:51,500
Copy that. Spooling up.

921
02:14:51,667 --> 02:14:52,934
Let me know what that
distribution looks like.

922
02:14:52,958 --> 02:14:53,958
Let's get over here.

923
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,684
- Readings have been confirmed.
- Link is ready!

924
02:14:55,708 --> 02:14:56,708
Pulling up now.

925
02:15:42,208 --> 02:15:43,625
Hello.

926
02:15:44,417 --> 02:15:45,792
Is anyone there?

927
02:15:45,958 --> 02:15:47,167
Come on.

928
02:15:47,333 --> 02:15:48,625
Do you hear me?

929
02:15:51,458 --> 02:15:52,583
Yes, hello?

930
02:15:53,042 --> 02:15:55,083
This is Fort Wayne,
Indiana. We read you!

931
02:15:56,417 --> 02:15:58,097
It's good to hear
another voice out there.

932
02:15:58,833 --> 02:16:00,708
Tell me where you are.
What's your location?
