1
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:46,328
Elder Luna says
make your heart still.

2
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:48,494
The right egg
will sing to you.

3
00:04:49,526 --> 00:04:52,560
Elder Luna is elder.

4
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:14,467
Three.

5
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:17,994
Only three.

6
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:20,059
We take them all.

7
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,527
No. Never.

8
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,626
Leave one always.

9
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,560
That is the law.

10
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,824
Bonding day is tomorrow.

11
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:35,857
These are yours.

12
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:38,658
You are older.

13
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:41,758
- By length of a sunset.
- Is older.

14
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:45,797
Soona.

15
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,164
Which one sings to you?

16
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:55,329
This one.

17
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:01,731
Silk.

18
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,956
We will raise them together.

19
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:18,999
Like we were raised.

20
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,527
It will be the same.

21
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:25,890
Yes?

22
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,956
Go, go, go.

23
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:43,296
- Noa!
- Noa, wait!

24
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,296
Whoa!

25
00:06:57,766 --> 00:06:59,094
It's too far.

26
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,560
Find another way.

27
00:07:04,864 --> 00:07:05,864
Noa?

28
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:08,328
No!

29
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:12,890
Yeah!

30
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:03,131
Noa!

31
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:07,395
Anaya! Soona!

32
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:08,996
Noa!

33
00:08:12,594 --> 00:08:14,131
- Noa!
- No!

34
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:40,377
Do you wonder
what your bird will look like?

35
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,857
Long as it does not
look like you, Anaya.

36
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,962
What is it, Noa?

37
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:14,560
Something in trees.

38
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:32,263
It's getting away.

39
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:48,923
Noa scared.

40
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:52,999
Not Anaya.

41
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:18,923
Not ape.

42
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,362
Maybe...

43
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:26,758
Echo?

44
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:33,527
Echo do not come in
from Valley.

45
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:34,863
Oh.

46
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:55,128
Were you scared?

47
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:57,230
Not as scared as Anaya!

48
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,401
They're back!
They're back!

49
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:27,425
Soona!

50
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:28,672
Did you
get your eggs?

51
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:31,158
- How far did you climb?
- Was it dangerous?

52
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:33,458
Very dangerous.

53
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:36,059
Anaya wailed like a newborn.

54
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:46,927
How many eggs
did you honor?

55
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:48,510
- Show us the egg.
- Did you climb well?

56
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:50,336
- Show us the egg.
- Show us your egg.

57
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Egg. Egg. Egg.

58
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,027
Show us, Anaya, please?

59
00:12:17,826 --> 00:12:19,625
- Who want?
- Me, me, me!

60
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,396
Aw!

61
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:26,032
Come on.
Come on. Give, give! Hey!

62
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:27,626
Son.

63
00:12:36,028 --> 00:12:37,061
Show me.

64
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:39,358
All must wait for bonding.

65
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:42,126
Even Honored Teacher.

66
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,065
I am your mother.

67
00:12:53,428 --> 00:12:56,263
I knew you would climb well.

68
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:00,065
He waits.

69
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:10,626
Broken?

70
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:15,164
Time for that later.

71
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,461
Your father will want to see.

72
00:13:47,168 --> 00:13:49,166
- Noa.
- Noa.

73
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:52,191
Noa, didn't
think you'd make it back.

74
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:26,531
Too firm.

75
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,032
Yes. Yes, Koro.

76
00:14:57,325 --> 00:14:58,329
Noa.

77
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,329
Son.

78
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:13,164
Sun Eagle does not like work
for tomorrow's ceremony.

79
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,032
You climb well?

80
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:19,531
Above Top Nest.

81
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,727
Huh. All of you?

82
00:15:21,863 --> 00:15:23,430
No.

83
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:24,956
Only me.

84
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,758
What that smell?

85
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:46,497
You did not go
to the Valley Beyond?

86
00:15:46,632 --> 00:15:47,927
Never.

87
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:50,197
Is forbidden.

88
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:55,196
Yet blood of Echo
on your blanket.

89
00:15:55,332 --> 00:15:58,527
We did not go
to Valley Beyond.

90
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:04,131
I accept.

91
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:07,494
You are true, Noa.

92
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:10,758
Much to learn.

93
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:13,725
Much to teach.

94
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:17,494
After tomorrow's bonding.

95
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,296
Now, Elders must know.

96
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:25,494
Echoes only bring trouble.

97
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,395
Oda will chase the pests away.

98
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:42,923
May I seek your counsel?

99
00:16:45,202 --> 00:16:50,323
This blanket had the blood
of an Echo on it.

100
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,526
Echo.

101
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:53,064
And I apologize
for that.

102
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,358
This is a bad sign
for all of us.

103
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:57,493
That smell.

104
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:58,704
And my suggestion
would be...

105
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,362
You climbed Top Nest?

106
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:14,065
Hard climb.

107
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:21,425
Ah, yes.

108
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:23,664
Could be dangerous.

109
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,824
Danger.

110
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:30,698
Anaya!

111
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,626
You see your father?

112
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,829
I do not understand Eagle Sun.

113
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:50,659
I do. He hate Noa.

114
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:57,225
Noa.

115
00:17:59,491 --> 00:18:01,197
With Elders.

116
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:06,032
They send Oda
to scare Echo away.

117
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:07,857
Yes, Elder.

118
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:11,725
When mother was small...

119
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,862
dry season shrank creek.

120
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:16,461
Echo range for food.

121
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:20,824
She saw a small and a big.

122
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:24,659
We have good rain.

123
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,461
Her words.

124
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,032
Ride true, Oda.

125
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,296
No.

126
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:18,899
Our bonding is at sunrise.

127
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:21,792
Master of Birds
will make exception.

128
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:24,927
They will not make him wait
for next season.

129
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:26,362
Yes, he will.

130
00:21:28,294 --> 00:21:30,258
He is your father.

131
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:34,395
And I am his son.

132
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:37,999
Then I will wait with you.

133
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,296
Anaya wait too.

134
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,428
You cannot.

135
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:54,626
I must find another.

136
00:23:43,764 --> 00:23:44,764
Noa.

137
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:46,566
Oda!

138
00:23:47,062 --> 00:23:49,329
There are...

139
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:52,027
more.

140
00:24:36,394 --> 00:24:38,324
What happened here?

141
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,032
Our scouts.

142
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:42,691
Killed by him.

143
00:24:50,995 --> 00:24:52,131
Human.

144
00:24:53,062 --> 00:24:54,524
It is her.

145
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,158
Lightning, back on your horse.

146
00:24:56,293 --> 00:24:57,531
Spread out!

147
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,830
Find his clan.

148
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,498
Search in all directions!

149
00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:11,159
The ape's horse!

150
00:25:11,295 --> 00:25:12,626
Lightning, come!

151
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:24,525
They cannot be far.

152
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:27,491
Follow the horse!
Find his clan!

153
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,725
Find human!

154
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:32,791
Ride!

155
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:39,098
Go, go, go!

156
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:41,861
Round them up!

157
00:26:41,996 --> 00:26:43,593
No! No! Please!

158
00:26:47,427 --> 00:26:48,857
You, prisoner!

159
00:26:51,265 --> 00:26:54,428
Burn it down.

160
00:26:57,965 --> 00:26:59,565
Soona! Anaya!

161
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,824
Noa, help!

162
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:12,461
Noa!

163
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,826
Noa!

164
00:27:14,962 --> 00:27:16,131
Noa!

165
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,830
Noa!

166
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:20,296
Noa!

167
00:27:21,295 --> 00:27:23,527
Anaya! Mother!

168
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:26,465
Where Soona?

169
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:28,499
They took her.

170
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:30,527
They broke my egg.

171
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,796
Mother.

172
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:34,129
Help your father!

173
00:27:34,265 --> 00:27:36,560
No! No!

174
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:38,864
Noa!

175
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,329
No!

176
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:45,197
Run, Noa! Run!

177
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:48,158
Help your father!

178
00:27:48,294 --> 00:27:50,131
Go, Noa! Run!

179
00:27:52,632 --> 00:27:53,632
No!

180
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,494
He their Elder.

181
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:07,564
No!

182
00:28:15,732 --> 00:28:18,489
For Caesar!

183
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,296
For Caesar!

184
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,956
Take them to Proximus!

185
00:28:26,392 --> 00:28:28,130
Find the human!

186
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,956
Caesar! Caesar!

187
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:34,296
Caesar! Caesar!

188
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:47,325
- Father.
- Son.

189
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:49,027
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

190
00:28:49,163 --> 00:28:51,131
Noa, free all birds.

191
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:52,467
Go.

192
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:31,692
Bend your head.

193
00:31:14,195 --> 00:31:15,494
Noa.

194
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:23,131
For Caesar.

195
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:22,963
Father...

196
00:34:26,294 --> 00:34:27,791
I will find them.

197
00:34:29,427 --> 00:34:32,527
I will bring them home.

198
00:36:27,127 --> 00:36:28,560
Mother.

199
00:37:39,401 --> 00:37:40,401
Sun.

200
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,164
Come, Sun.

201
00:39:57,766 --> 00:39:59,956
How young you are.

202
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,857
Without your mask.

203
00:40:04,997 --> 00:40:06,461
Without this.

204
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:09,857
Speak up.

205
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:14,329
Speak up.

206
00:40:15,062 --> 00:40:16,461
Not mine.

207
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,857
No mask.

208
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,329
I am not...

209
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,527
them.

210
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:27,956
Explain yourself.

211
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:31,494
They killed my father.

212
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:34,527
Stole my village.

213
00:40:36,658 --> 00:40:38,461
I follow their tracks.

214
00:40:41,995 --> 00:40:43,527
Hmm.

215
00:40:50,162 --> 00:40:53,494
He was my village.

216
00:40:56,732 --> 00:40:58,692
They killed him.

217
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:01,494
The Masks.

218
00:41:13,996 --> 00:41:15,329
I am Raka.

219
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,494
I am Noa.

220
00:41:32,135 --> 00:41:36,999
Apes falling
from the sky. Hmm.

221
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:45,126
He was outside
when they arrived.

222
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:47,131
Did you see my clan?

223
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:49,329
No.

224
00:41:50,226 --> 00:41:51,626
I hid.

225
00:41:52,831 --> 00:41:54,197
I survived.

226
00:41:55,658 --> 00:41:58,758
I protected our work.

227
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:13,791
They are an ancient way
to store ideas.

228
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,494
The symbols have meaning.

229
00:42:25,594 --> 00:42:28,698
Apes understood
this meaning...

230
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,857
in the time of Caesar.

231
00:42:33,461 --> 00:42:36,857
The Masks, in my village...

232
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,362
said that name...

233
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,791
"Caesar."

234
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:46,230
Shameful.

235
00:42:47,328 --> 00:42:49,527
The Masks take his name.

236
00:42:51,062 --> 00:42:52,428
Twist his words.

237
00:42:53,326 --> 00:42:55,032
Who is he?

238
00:42:55,831 --> 00:42:56,956
Not "is."

239
00:42:58,094 --> 00:42:59,098
"Was."

240
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:07,790
Your clan does not know
the true Caesar.

241
00:43:07,926 --> 00:43:11,131
Too many have forgotten
who he was.

242
00:43:13,263 --> 00:43:16,060
I know Elders of my village.

243
00:43:16,195 --> 00:43:17,965
They made the law.

244
00:43:18,101 --> 00:43:21,093
That is everything.

245
00:43:21,229 --> 00:43:24,098
That is not everything.

246
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:27,025
Long before your Elders...

247
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,460
it was Caesar who taught us
what it means to be ape.

248
00:43:31,596 --> 00:43:36,061
He was our leader,
our lawgiver.

249
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,994
Apes together strong.

250
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,863
Ape shall not kill ape.

251
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:44,796
We, the Order of Caesar...

252
00:43:44,931 --> 00:43:46,696
follow his words.

253
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,296
To this day...

254
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:51,131
I follow.

255
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:54,098
I am now...

256
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:56,824
the last.

257
00:43:58,932 --> 00:44:00,824
The work continues.

258
00:44:03,464 --> 00:44:06,963
What is this place?

259
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:09,994
We believe apes built this...

260
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:13,690
as a refuge for humans.

261
00:44:13,825 --> 00:44:15,728
Now it is rare
to see even one.

262
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:21,164
But in Caesar's time,
there were vast herds of them.

263
00:44:22,263 --> 00:44:24,858
Can you imagine?

264
00:44:24,994 --> 00:44:29,590
Perhaps here,
humans were cared for, fed...

265
00:44:29,725 --> 00:44:33,494
maybe even taught.

266
00:44:39,996 --> 00:44:41,065
What is it?

267
00:44:42,962 --> 00:44:44,131
Echo.

268
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:49,494
Human.

269
00:44:52,294 --> 00:44:53,824
You have seen one?

270
00:44:54,665 --> 00:44:55,665
One.

271
00:44:57,493 --> 00:44:59,696
They are scavengers.

272
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:01,597
Like boars.

273
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,359
Only lesser.

274
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:07,164
Humans are slow-witted, but...

275
00:45:08,734 --> 00:45:11,033
there was a time...

276
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:15,065
when humans and apes
lived side by side.

277
00:45:18,992 --> 00:45:24,230
Yes, it is a puzzle.
I know. But...

278
00:45:25,596 --> 00:45:28,359
they were important
to Caesar. Hmm.

279
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:32,659
So they are important to me.

280
00:45:37,164 --> 00:45:39,263
I have to get to my horse.

281
00:45:40,534 --> 00:45:42,125
Of course.

282
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,395
Follow me.

283
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:49,791
You do not know Caesar.

284
00:45:51,295 --> 00:45:53,659
You do not know books.

285
00:45:57,734 --> 00:45:59,691
You should stay here.

286
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:02,257
There is much
I could teach you.

287
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:11,292
Go away!

288
00:46:11,427 --> 00:46:13,829
- No! Come back!
- Pest!

289
00:46:13,965 --> 00:46:16,065
Wait! Come back!

290
00:46:16,998 --> 00:46:19,857
There is no danger.

291
00:46:20,831 --> 00:46:22,962
That is the one.

292
00:46:23,097 --> 00:46:25,494
Stole from my village.

293
00:46:26,892 --> 00:46:30,296
She follows you
from your village?

294
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,758
Perhaps Caesar bids me travel.

295
00:46:42,835 --> 00:46:45,523
Wait here. The work continues.

296
00:46:45,658 --> 00:46:46,859
I have no time for...

297
00:46:46,994 --> 00:46:50,125
I will not slow you down.
I, too, keep a horse.

298
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:00,123
Can we not slow down?

299
00:47:00,259 --> 00:47:01,329
No.

300
00:47:04,493 --> 00:47:06,499
I am sure she follows.

301
00:47:06,634 --> 00:47:08,258
I do not know why.

302
00:47:12,626 --> 00:47:16,362
A beautiful bird!

303
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,131
Eagle Sun.

304
00:47:21,195 --> 00:47:22,659
My father's bird.

305
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:25,692
He follows to taunt me.

306
00:47:26,966 --> 00:47:30,758
This bird follows you too?

307
00:47:32,296 --> 00:47:35,197
We raise eagles, my clan.

308
00:47:35,963 --> 00:47:36,999
Sing to them...

309
00:47:37,963 --> 00:47:39,430
so they know us.

310
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:40,692
A bond.

311
00:47:42,898 --> 00:47:44,197
Sing the song.

312
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,362
Please.

313
00:47:49,698 --> 00:47:50,698
No.

314
00:47:52,693 --> 00:47:54,697
My father was Master of Birds.

315
00:47:54,832 --> 00:47:56,329
He sang to eagles.

316
00:47:58,525 --> 00:48:00,494
But I am not him.

317
00:48:02,467 --> 00:48:03,467
Shame.

318
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,862
I would have enjoyed a song.

319
00:48:30,029 --> 00:48:31,527
Strange weapons.

320
00:48:32,896 --> 00:48:33,896
Broken.

321
00:49:06,259 --> 00:49:07,329
Raka.

322
00:49:11,995 --> 00:49:12,999
Noa.

323
00:49:19,299 --> 00:49:22,296
She follows
because she is hungry.

324
00:49:31,029 --> 00:49:32,527
No, no, no.

325
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:36,197
This is...

326
00:49:38,128 --> 00:49:39,626
important.

327
00:49:41,162 --> 00:49:43,329
They get cold.

328
00:49:46,491 --> 00:49:48,098
Show mercy.

329
00:50:10,098 --> 00:50:12,461
She is smarter than most.

330
00:50:18,262 --> 00:50:21,329
We will name her Nova.

331
00:50:23,493 --> 00:50:27,297
We name them all Nova.

332
00:50:27,433 --> 00:50:31,231
I do not know why.
It is from Caesar's time.

333
00:50:31,366 --> 00:50:36,625
Why did Caesar care so much
for Echoes?

334
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:41,428
Legend says
he was reared by them...

335
00:50:42,966 --> 00:50:45,428
impossible as that may seem.

336
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:49,131
Caesar legend is important.

337
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,527
He was first Elder.

338
00:50:55,097 --> 00:50:57,956
He led with decency...

339
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:00,659
morality...

340
00:51:02,425 --> 00:51:03,791
strength...

341
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,296
compassion.

342
00:51:13,165 --> 00:51:16,329
Caesar never had
to share camp...

343
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:19,758
with this Nova.

344
00:51:31,866 --> 00:51:33,890
The smell is potent.

345
00:54:27,966 --> 00:54:32,659
A tunnel that eats light?

346
00:54:33,932 --> 00:54:35,824
She saw what I saw.

347
00:54:36,932 --> 00:54:38,530
It was in her eyes.

348
00:54:38,665 --> 00:54:39,857
She...

349
00:54:40,929 --> 00:54:42,197
reacted.

350
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:44,362
How?

351
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:49,659
As ape would.

352
00:54:57,431 --> 00:54:59,863
- If Echo comes, she must ride.
- Hmm.

353
00:54:59,998 --> 00:55:04,032
Is my young companion showing compassion
for our fellow traveler?

354
00:55:05,029 --> 00:55:06,230
She is slow.

355
00:55:23,962 --> 00:55:25,791
Horse.

356
00:55:34,926 --> 00:55:38,296
Then, of course,
there is the gibbon.

357
00:55:39,097 --> 00:55:41,062
Very, very long arms.

358
00:55:41,198 --> 00:55:48,198
Is most unfortunate that the human can
only use its feet for walking.

359
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:50,826
Imagine if you were falling
from a tree.

360
00:55:50,961 --> 00:55:53,529
You only have two appendages
to save your life.

361
00:55:53,665 --> 00:55:56,994
But if you were able to use
both of your hands...

362
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,128
and both of your feet...

363
00:55:59,264 --> 00:56:01,628
that's four times the safety.

364
00:56:01,764 --> 00:56:06,626
And I imagine that,
if I came across a special...

365
00:56:08,492 --> 00:56:10,961
What is that?

366
00:56:37,196 --> 00:56:39,890
Horses with stripes.

367
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:44,197
Quite striking.

368
00:57:32,563 --> 00:57:36,791
We feared the herds
ceased to exist.

369
00:58:00,494 --> 00:58:02,758
Will you not say goodbye?

370
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,197
I must find my clan.

371
00:58:09,934 --> 00:58:12,626
The Nova stays with her kind.

372
00:58:13,832 --> 00:58:15,461
You raise them up.

373
00:58:16,965 --> 00:58:20,692
Follow Caesar's word.

374
00:58:30,634 --> 00:58:32,131
To remember...

375
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:35,296
who he was.

376
00:58:39,161 --> 00:58:41,164
It is important.

377
00:59:11,327 --> 00:59:12,791
They are like you.

378
00:59:14,494 --> 00:59:16,461
Would you like to join them?

379
00:59:34,998 --> 00:59:36,999
He has his journey.

380
00:59:38,096 --> 00:59:39,956
We have ours.

381
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:41,599
Come.

382
01:00:29,996 --> 01:00:30,999
Nova!

383
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,296
Nova!

384
01:00:59,963 --> 01:01:01,131
Take them!

385
01:01:07,295 --> 01:01:08,762
Ride them down!

386
01:01:08,897 --> 01:01:10,758
Catch that one!

387
01:01:52,633 --> 01:01:54,791
This one? Hyah!

388
01:02:01,665 --> 01:02:02,665
There!

389
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,993
Spread out.

390
01:02:26,128 --> 01:02:27,131
Lightning.

391
01:02:39,963 --> 01:02:40,963
This way.

392
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:42,930
Find her!

393
01:02:51,194 --> 01:02:53,890
I know she here!

394
01:02:57,765 --> 01:02:59,065
Raka!

395
01:03:00,995 --> 01:03:02,065
Nova!

396
01:03:03,898 --> 01:03:05,191
Come out!

397
01:03:05,326 --> 01:03:07,032
I smell you!

398
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:10,527
Raka!

399
01:03:17,063 --> 01:03:18,063
Noa!

400
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:43,830
Hyah!

401
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:10,162
Noa!

402
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:19,631
Raka!

403
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,164
Caesar will forgive.

404
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:25,626
Shall we continue?

405
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:49,296
This should give us time.

406
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:29,564
What did I miss?

407
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:31,164
She spoke.

408
01:05:34,031 --> 01:05:36,389
She called my name.

409
01:05:36,525 --> 01:05:38,924
You misheard.

410
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:43,764
You said this Nova
was smarter than most.

411
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:45,329
Within reason.

412
01:05:46,497 --> 01:05:48,795
Some intelligence,
to be sure, but...

413
01:05:48,931 --> 01:05:50,461
I have a name.

414
01:05:52,401 --> 01:05:53,401
Mae.

415
01:05:57,795 --> 01:06:00,065
I know where
they're taking your clan.

416
01:06:09,361 --> 01:06:10,956
It's a human settlement.

417
01:06:12,626 --> 01:06:14,764
It's where I'm headed to.

418
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,598
Looking for more like me.

419
01:06:16,733 --> 01:06:18,164
There are more...

420
01:06:19,095 --> 01:06:20,164
like you?

421
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:24,461
There used to be more.

422
01:06:25,294 --> 01:06:28,359
You hid the truth?

423
01:06:28,495 --> 01:06:30,692
My mother taught me silence...

424
01:06:32,195 --> 01:06:33,824
for my safety.

425
01:06:34,592 --> 01:06:38,027
You were safe with us.

426
01:06:38,163 --> 01:06:40,857
And still not true.

427
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,593
Where is your mother now?

428
01:06:47,897 --> 01:06:49,824
I am alone.

429
01:06:50,633 --> 01:06:53,032
Huh.

430
01:06:54,162 --> 01:06:56,362
As are we all.

431
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,824
But now...

432
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,791
we have each other.

433
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,956
Ah.

434
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:18,961
Let us have a fire.

435
01:07:19,097 --> 01:07:21,494
We have much to discuss.

436
01:10:48,698 --> 01:10:49,999
Go back.

437
01:10:50,797 --> 01:10:51,899
Go back!

438
01:10:58,467 --> 01:10:59,467
Noa!

439
01:11:02,864 --> 01:11:04,065
Mae!

440
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:10,595
Mae!

441
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:11,758
No!

442
01:11:26,731 --> 01:11:27,824
Mae!

443
01:11:32,401 --> 01:11:33,401
Hold on!

444
01:11:33,996 --> 01:11:35,659
Mae!

445
01:11:50,831 --> 01:11:52,365
No! Raka!

446
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,500
Raka!

447
01:12:07,666 --> 01:12:08,923
Together...

448
01:12:10,094 --> 01:12:11,263
strong.

449
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,027
Stand back! Human!

450
01:14:33,799 --> 01:14:35,032
No! No! No!

451
01:14:49,262 --> 01:14:51,890
Welcome home, baby bird.

452
01:15:02,467 --> 01:15:03,467
Go!

453
01:15:56,592 --> 01:15:58,360
Noa?

454
01:15:58,495 --> 01:16:01,163
Noa!

455
01:16:01,299 --> 01:16:04,230
I missed you.
Soona. Soona.

456
01:16:07,632 --> 01:16:08,632
No.

457
01:16:11,492 --> 01:16:13,461
You were dead.

458
01:16:14,767 --> 01:16:17,126
I... I saw you fall.

459
01:16:17,261 --> 01:16:19,857
You are not hurt?

460
01:16:21,094 --> 01:16:22,098
No.

461
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:23,830
No.

462
01:16:29,325 --> 01:16:30,992
Mother?

463
01:16:31,127 --> 01:16:32,131
Anaya?

464
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:24,824
Vonnegut.

465
01:17:25,931 --> 01:17:27,362
That's a good one.

466
01:17:28,329 --> 01:17:30,625
Not a lot of fiction there.

467
01:17:30,761 --> 01:17:33,857
He's mostly interested
in history.

468
01:17:35,761 --> 01:17:38,692
Roman history, especially.

469
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,828
The name's Trevathan.

470
01:17:48,427 --> 01:17:50,159
Where, uh...

471
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:51,626
Where are you from?

472
01:17:54,666 --> 01:17:55,890
You first.

473
01:17:57,926 --> 01:18:01,694
Well, doesn't really matter,
does it?

474
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:03,032
I left.

475
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,161
Same as you.

476
01:18:06,296 --> 01:18:08,899
Made it almost to the coast

477
01:18:09,035 --> 01:18:12,163
and then I fell
and shattered my ankles.

478
01:18:12,298 --> 01:18:14,164
That's where
Proximus found me.

479
01:18:15,992 --> 01:18:20,323
And now you read him
Roman history.

480
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:25,527
So, who are you?

481
01:18:26,794 --> 01:18:29,923
I'm the human
not helping the apes.

482
01:18:46,062 --> 01:18:47,465
Noa.

483
01:18:49,734 --> 01:18:51,794
Share. Must share.

484
01:18:51,929 --> 01:18:52,929
Good.

485
01:18:56,997 --> 01:18:58,295
Noa?

486
01:18:58,431 --> 01:18:59,743
- Noa!
- You're alive!

487
01:19:17,326 --> 01:19:18,560
Father...

488
01:19:19,358 --> 01:19:20,463
he's...

489
01:19:20,599 --> 01:19:22,857
I know.

490
01:19:40,227 --> 01:19:42,032
We must go.

491
01:19:43,599 --> 01:19:44,796
Come.

492
01:19:54,766 --> 01:19:56,230
Caesar!

493
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:09,032
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

494
01:20:54,163 --> 01:20:56,491
What a wonderful day!

495
01:20:56,626 --> 01:20:59,526
What a wonderful day!

496
01:20:59,662 --> 01:21:03,532
Are we thankful
for the words of Caesar?

497
01:21:03,668 --> 01:21:05,566
We are thankful.

498
01:21:05,701 --> 01:21:07,828
Do we bend our heads?

499
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:09,791
We bend!

500
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,194
Say his words!

501
01:21:12,329 --> 01:21:14,391
Apes together strong!

502
01:21:14,527 --> 01:21:16,227
Say his words!

503
01:21:16,362 --> 01:21:18,731
Apes together strong!

504
01:21:18,866 --> 01:21:21,532
What a wonderful day!

505
01:21:31,062 --> 01:21:33,029
That felt good.

506
01:21:33,165 --> 01:21:36,092
When I think on those words...

507
01:21:36,227 --> 01:21:39,131
I feel good.

508
01:21:41,592 --> 01:21:44,828
Caesar was first Elder.

509
01:21:44,963 --> 01:21:48,928
Now I am Caesar.

510
01:21:52,129 --> 01:21:54,197
He is not Caesar.

511
01:22:02,328 --> 01:22:08,124
Now, when I think of all the treasures
left inside for us...

512
01:22:08,259 --> 01:22:09,895
Oh...

513
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:12,999
I feel very good.

514
01:22:15,593 --> 01:22:17,999
It may be difficult to open.

515
01:22:19,097 --> 01:22:20,632
But not impossible...

516
01:22:20,768 --> 01:22:23,659
because we work together.

517
01:22:24,699 --> 01:22:27,126
All as one.

518
01:22:27,261 --> 01:22:29,192
As Caesar wanted.

519
01:22:29,328 --> 01:22:32,326
As Caesar required.

520
01:22:32,461 --> 01:22:35,131
Apes together strong!

521
01:22:35,995 --> 01:22:36,995
Pull!

522
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:49,494
Pull!

523
01:22:50,559 --> 01:22:52,494
Pull! More!

524
01:22:58,765 --> 01:22:59,857
Watch this.

525
01:23:13,032 --> 01:23:14,729
- Pull!
- Pull!

526
01:23:14,864 --> 01:23:16,890
Pull!

527
01:23:21,864 --> 01:23:23,263
Yes!

528
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,065
Yes!

529
01:23:30,665 --> 01:23:32,494
More!

530
01:23:43,896 --> 01:23:45,192
Enough!

531
01:23:50,767 --> 01:23:54,758
Maybe stronger tomorrow.

532
01:24:14,293 --> 01:24:15,725
Don't worry.

533
01:24:15,861 --> 01:24:18,197
Whoever's in there
is either dead or gone.

534
01:24:19,861 --> 01:24:22,791
We've been bangin'
on that door for months.

535
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,159
Do you not know
where we are?

536
01:24:28,294 --> 01:24:31,623
When things got bad
and the government went underground,

537
01:24:31,759 --> 01:24:33,661
this is where half of it went.

538
01:24:33,796 --> 01:24:36,956
With all their technology,
and all their weapons...

539
01:24:39,394 --> 01:24:41,495
Don't you understand?

540
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:43,925
That ape cannot have
what is inside the...

541
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:47,197
You gotta stop thinking
about the way things were

542
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,593
and start thinking
about the way they are.

543
01:24:50,262 --> 01:24:51,759
This is a good life,

544
01:24:51,894 --> 01:24:54,691
and you have a chance
to be a part of it.

545
01:24:54,827 --> 01:24:57,259
What, and build a world
for the apes?

546
01:24:57,395 --> 01:25:00,164
It is already their world.

547
01:25:08,294 --> 01:25:11,230
There's hot water and fresh clothes
in that room back there.

548
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:15,560
You'll feel better
when you get yourself cleaned up.

549
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,626
You better figure out
how to be useful around here.

550
01:25:26,592 --> 01:25:27,824
Honored Elder...

551
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:29,930
had to bend.

552
01:25:31,865 --> 01:25:34,065
We had no choice.

553
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:37,461
You must accept.

554
01:25:40,798 --> 01:25:41,956
It is law.

555
01:25:44,233 --> 01:25:49,258
The Elders
did not tell us everything

556
01:25:49,393 --> 01:25:52,199
about this world.

557
01:25:52,334 --> 01:25:55,999
They did not tell us
because they did not know.

558
01:25:57,296 --> 01:26:00,428
They did not want to know.

559
01:26:06,894 --> 01:26:09,158
You are different.

560
01:26:12,358 --> 01:26:13,527
Come.

561
01:26:28,665 --> 01:26:30,994
And that's why
they call it a toga party.

562
01:26:34,334 --> 01:26:38,291
You are a funny
little human, Trevathan.

563
01:26:43,734 --> 01:26:44,923
Hey, come.

564
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:46,593
Come, sit.

565
01:26:48,467 --> 01:26:49,997
Please.

566
01:26:51,962 --> 01:26:52,962
Go.

567
01:26:53,632 --> 01:26:54,659
Go.

568
01:27:05,394 --> 01:27:07,692
Wonderful day, yes?

569
01:27:11,363 --> 01:27:14,296
You two have come a long way.

570
01:27:16,294 --> 01:27:18,631
An ape and a human

571
01:27:18,767 --> 01:27:20,362
traveling together is...

572
01:27:21,998 --> 01:27:23,898
quite an adventure.

573
01:27:26,164 --> 01:27:27,626
You are Noa, yes?

574
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:30,461
Welcome, Noa.

575
01:27:45,467 --> 01:27:46,467
Go.

576
01:27:53,995 --> 01:27:55,493
Mae...

577
01:27:55,629 --> 01:27:59,263
you are familiar
with the concept of...

578
01:27:59,897 --> 01:28:01,699
evolution?

579
01:28:01,835 --> 01:28:04,429
That is the human label, yeah?

580
01:28:04,564 --> 01:28:09,033
The advancement
that I crave requires time.

581
01:28:09,168 --> 01:28:13,032
Vast amounts of time
that I do not have.

582
01:28:14,366 --> 01:28:17,526
Unfortunately, I am
but a mortal ape.

583
01:28:19,833 --> 01:28:24,863
So this is why I need
to get the knowledge inside that vault.

584
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:26,324
I believe it will deliver

585
01:28:26,459 --> 01:28:29,692
instant evolution.

586
01:28:30,699 --> 01:28:32,857
Hmm. Noa.

587
01:28:33,932 --> 01:28:35,230
You don't understand.

588
01:28:36,667 --> 01:28:38,133
In their time,

589
01:28:38,268 --> 01:28:43,897
humans were capable
of many great things, yes?

590
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:46,296
They could level mountains.

591
01:28:48,099 --> 01:28:50,532
They could speak
across oceans.

592
01:28:50,668 --> 01:28:53,263
They could fly, Noa.

593
01:28:53,798 --> 01:28:55,664
Like eagles fly.

594
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,933
But now, we will learn.

595
01:28:59,068 --> 01:29:02,592
Apes will learn.
I will learn, yeah,

596
01:29:02,728 --> 01:29:05,931
from what is inside
that vault.

597
01:29:06,067 --> 01:29:08,164
It's impossible.

598
01:29:09,834 --> 01:29:11,532
No one's getting in there.

599
01:29:16,932 --> 01:29:19,131
Mae, Mae, Mae, Mae.

600
01:29:20,761 --> 01:29:26,626
My apes encountered
your companions.

601
01:29:27,793 --> 01:29:31,164
I believe this map
belonged to you.

602
01:29:31,799 --> 01:29:33,690
You see, Noa,

603
01:29:33,825 --> 01:29:36,291
before she was traveling
with you

604
01:29:36,427 --> 01:29:40,523
and that old orangutan,

605
01:29:40,659 --> 01:29:43,866
Mae was with other humans.

606
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:48,197
But sadly,

607
01:29:50,068 --> 01:29:53,590
my apes did not realize
their value,

608
01:29:53,726 --> 01:29:58,090
so I was brought only bodies.

609
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:02,626
I could not speak to them
like I can speak to you.

610
01:30:04,567 --> 01:30:06,528
I know...

611
01:30:06,663 --> 01:30:10,092
you are coming here
to get inside my vault.

612
01:30:10,227 --> 01:30:11,793
It is not yours!

613
01:30:11,929 --> 01:30:13,489
Oh.

614
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:16,032
It is now, isn't it?

615
01:30:17,064 --> 01:30:20,163
And I will get inside.

616
01:30:20,299 --> 01:30:24,560
No matter how many apes
it costs me.

617
01:30:25,467 --> 01:30:26,467
Noa.

618
01:30:26,929 --> 01:30:28,562
I...

619
01:30:28,698 --> 01:30:33,692
I have heard that you are
a very clever ape, yeah?

620
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:35,859
Very clever.

621
01:30:35,994 --> 01:30:39,857
He repaired one of your
broken staffs, Trevathan.

622
01:30:42,793 --> 01:30:46,565
I have much use
for clever apes.

623
01:30:46,701 --> 01:30:49,263
Now, can you tell me...

624
01:30:51,093 --> 01:30:55,131
did Mae tell you
how to get inside my vault?

625
01:31:00,427 --> 01:31:01,923
She told me nothing.

626
01:31:02,835 --> 01:31:04,529
Told you nothing!

627
01:31:04,665 --> 01:31:05,665
Nothing.

628
01:31:09,459 --> 01:31:11,329
Told you nothing.

629
01:31:15,566 --> 01:31:16,593
Noa.

630
01:31:17,592 --> 01:31:19,630
Come. Come with me.

631
01:31:19,765 --> 01:31:20,890
Come, come.

632
01:31:22,429 --> 01:31:23,999
I have something to show you.

633
01:31:25,029 --> 01:31:26,999
Come. Come.

634
01:31:28,831 --> 01:31:29,956
Come, Noa.

635
01:31:31,626 --> 01:31:33,692
Tell me, what do you see?

636
01:31:43,261 --> 01:31:45,461
Stolen clans.

637
01:31:48,095 --> 01:31:49,494
Not clans.

638
01:31:51,392 --> 01:31:52,461
A kingdom.

639
01:31:54,064 --> 01:31:57,758
Noa, a kingdom for apes.

640
01:32:02,494 --> 01:32:06,295
Humans can never be trusted.

641
01:32:06,431 --> 01:32:09,489
Where there are two
that can speak,

642
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:11,098
there must be more.

643
01:32:13,259 --> 01:32:18,996
Mae has come here to claim
the tools inside my vault.

644
01:32:19,132 --> 01:32:22,324
Tools that make humans strong

645
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:24,527
and make them dangerous.

646
01:32:27,101 --> 01:32:29,299
That is why
I must have them first.

647
01:32:29,434 --> 01:32:30,660
Yeah?

648
01:32:30,796 --> 01:32:36,225
They do not understand
that this is our time.

649
01:32:36,361 --> 01:32:38,494
This is my kingdom.

650
01:32:41,834 --> 01:32:44,857
I must destroy their kind.

651
01:32:45,992 --> 01:32:49,461
Unless we want to live
in cages again.

652
01:32:56,434 --> 01:32:57,696
Come.

653
01:32:57,831 --> 01:32:59,356
Come, Noa.

654
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:00,824
Let us eat.

655
01:33:02,831 --> 01:33:03,857
Trevathan!

656
01:33:04,458 --> 01:33:06,291
Tell us a story.

657
01:33:06,427 --> 01:33:08,131
Make it a funny one.

658
01:33:31,131 --> 01:33:32,999
They will not come.

659
01:33:36,797 --> 01:33:37,797
Why?

660
01:33:39,701 --> 01:33:42,131
Because Eagle Clan...

661
01:33:44,028 --> 01:33:45,131
is gone.

662
01:33:48,427 --> 01:33:53,494
Eagle Clan is here.

663
01:33:54,491 --> 01:33:57,032
We are here.

664
01:33:59,559 --> 01:34:01,494
In land of Proximus.

665
01:34:03,266 --> 01:34:08,197
And Proximus has no need
for eagles.

666
01:34:42,625 --> 01:34:46,461
You come to judge me?

667
01:34:51,864 --> 01:34:53,692
I judge myself.

668
01:34:55,493 --> 01:34:59,324
I promised our father

669
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:01,032
I would bring them home.

670
01:35:05,458 --> 01:35:06,692
I failed.

671
01:35:08,964 --> 01:35:11,456
Eagle Clan belongs

672
01:35:11,592 --> 01:35:15,626
to Proximus Caesar now.

673
01:35:19,293 --> 01:35:21,857
That is the law.

674
01:35:37,295 --> 01:35:41,999
But the law is wrong.

675
01:36:29,795 --> 01:36:32,528
Time for
the evening lesson.

676
01:36:32,663 --> 01:36:35,560
It would be very good for you
to be there.

677
01:37:14,596 --> 01:37:17,263
You did not come
for Echoes.

678
01:37:18,932 --> 01:37:21,824
And you were not alone.

679
01:37:23,128 --> 01:37:24,197
I'm sorry.

680
01:37:26,792 --> 01:37:29,197
Proximus's apes
found our camp.

681
01:37:31,899 --> 01:37:33,428
They killed everyone.

682
01:37:34,799 --> 01:37:36,725
I barely escaped.

683
01:37:37,668 --> 01:37:40,131
I needed your help.

684
01:37:40,267 --> 01:37:43,126
- And I was afraid.
- The more you speak,

685
01:37:43,262 --> 01:37:45,293
the less I believe.

686
01:37:45,429 --> 01:37:47,357
I was wrong not to trust you.

687
01:37:47,493 --> 01:37:48,526
And I know that now.

688
01:37:48,662 --> 01:37:51,791
I trust you
only to help yourself.

689
01:37:54,164 --> 01:37:56,626
But that could help me now.

690
01:38:00,964 --> 01:38:02,395
I have questions.

691
01:38:03,798 --> 01:38:05,329
You answer true,

692
01:38:06,162 --> 01:38:07,527
maybe I help.

693
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:13,098
What do you need inside vault?

694
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:16,500
It's...

695
01:38:17,425 --> 01:38:18,626
like a book.

696
01:38:19,768 --> 01:38:21,164
- A special book.
- How?

697
01:38:22,566 --> 01:38:23,566
Special?

698
01:38:25,068 --> 01:38:27,823
Humans lost their ability
to speak.

699
01:38:27,959 --> 01:38:29,692
And this book
might bring it back.

700
01:38:31,394 --> 01:38:33,164
A book can do this?

701
01:38:33,997 --> 01:38:35,263
This one can.

702
01:38:42,659 --> 01:38:47,230
Raka said apes and humans

703
01:38:48,592 --> 01:38:50,197
lived side by side.

704
01:38:52,832 --> 01:38:54,164
True or not true?

705
01:38:57,294 --> 01:38:58,461
Apes were silent.

706
01:39:00,129 --> 01:39:01,395
Like the Echo.

707
01:39:03,097 --> 01:39:04,659
Humans were dominant.

708
01:39:06,163 --> 01:39:07,527
The virus spread...

709
01:39:08,798 --> 01:39:10,263
that we created.

710
01:39:11,295 --> 01:39:12,923
It made apes smarter.

711
01:39:14,298 --> 01:39:16,296
And it almost killed
all of us.

712
01:39:23,164 --> 01:39:25,857
You know a way inside, yes?

713
01:39:27,566 --> 01:39:28,566
Yes.

714
01:39:30,129 --> 01:39:31,923
One last question.

715
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:39,329
Will water destroy
what is inside?

716
01:39:59,797 --> 01:40:00,797
Noa.

717
01:40:13,599 --> 01:40:15,863
A climb.

718
01:40:15,998 --> 01:40:19,529
One I cannot do alone.

719
01:40:19,665 --> 01:40:20,665
Why?

720
01:40:21,997 --> 01:40:24,758
To free our clan.

721
01:41:24,965 --> 01:41:27,263
Soona, this is Mae.

722
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:30,791
Hello, Soona.

723
01:41:35,294 --> 01:41:36,626
What do we do?

724
01:41:38,726 --> 01:41:40,197
We're gonna need all of this.

725
01:41:41,227 --> 01:41:42,362
Follow me.

726
01:41:56,094 --> 01:41:57,230
Careful.

727
01:42:00,131 --> 01:42:04,065
The power runs through, yes?

728
01:42:06,434 --> 01:42:07,434
Yes.

729
01:42:23,835 --> 01:42:27,428
You cannot make hard climb...

730
01:42:30,294 --> 01:42:31,791
without Anaya.

731
01:42:45,831 --> 01:42:46,999
Hello, Echo.

732
01:43:04,262 --> 01:43:05,730
This burns hot.

733
01:43:05,866 --> 01:43:07,362
But under pressure,

734
01:43:08,798 --> 01:43:10,824
it will explode.

735
01:43:12,262 --> 01:43:14,399
How do you know this?

736
01:43:20,666 --> 01:43:21,857
Oh, shit.

737
01:43:27,127 --> 01:43:28,131
"Shit"?

738
01:43:29,432 --> 01:43:31,597
- Take that over there.
- Okay.

739
01:43:31,732 --> 01:43:33,626
I go with Anaya.

740
01:43:34,227 --> 01:43:35,791
Safer that way.

741
01:43:37,163 --> 01:43:40,625
Anaya! Anaya. Stop.

742
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:42,993
- You're doing it wrong.
- Okay.

743
01:43:43,129 --> 01:43:44,263
You like her.

744
01:43:46,764 --> 01:43:47,764
Soona.

745
01:43:49,868 --> 01:43:51,791
We were born within a sunset.

746
01:43:55,493 --> 01:43:56,693
No. Anaya...

747
01:43:56,828 --> 01:43:58,531
He's just
going to rebuild it.

748
01:44:10,292 --> 01:44:11,296
You...

749
01:44:13,965 --> 01:44:15,995
You had an opportunity.

750
01:44:16,131 --> 01:44:18,862
I gave you an opportunity.

751
01:44:18,997 --> 01:44:23,626
But you're fantasizing about a past
that can never come back.

752
01:44:30,162 --> 01:44:31,527
Listen to me.

753
01:44:33,002 --> 01:44:37,428
Trevathan,
you don't belong here.

754
01:44:38,932 --> 01:44:41,125
You think it's over,

755
01:44:41,261 --> 01:44:42,494
but it's not.

756
01:44:43,928 --> 01:44:47,923
Nobody is going to blame you
for what happened here.

757
01:44:49,733 --> 01:44:52,791
Just come with us.

758
01:44:55,599 --> 01:44:56,599
Please?

759
01:45:04,199 --> 01:45:06,626
He's gonna skin
your monkey alive.

760
01:45:11,161 --> 01:45:12,164
And you...

761
01:45:13,325 --> 01:45:14,329
Well...

762
01:45:16,427 --> 01:45:18,230
you're gonna learn.

763
01:45:26,229 --> 01:45:27,298
Oh, no.

764
01:45:27,434 --> 01:45:28,456
Please!

765
01:46:29,492 --> 01:46:30,862
We need to go.

766
01:46:30,998 --> 01:46:32,263
It'll be light soon.

767
01:46:52,597 --> 01:46:55,065
You said
there would be climb!

768
01:47:09,425 --> 01:47:10,461
Mae, wait!

769
01:47:17,962 --> 01:47:19,296
Mae!

770
01:47:23,434 --> 01:47:24,434
There!

771
01:47:25,361 --> 01:47:27,197
We need to go up there.

772
01:47:29,097 --> 01:47:30,824
Now we climb?

773
01:47:52,068 --> 01:47:54,164
Easier
than Top Nest.

774
01:47:54,997 --> 01:47:56,164
Keep climbing.

775
01:48:19,863 --> 01:48:20,863
Noa!

776
01:48:33,896 --> 01:48:34,896
Shit?

777
01:48:36,129 --> 01:48:37,131
Mm-hmm.

778
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:41,956
Wait. Careful.

779
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:48,164
Oops.

780
01:49:48,964 --> 01:49:50,065
Anaya!

781
01:50:19,365 --> 01:50:23,065
Noa,
what is this place?

782
01:50:25,634 --> 01:50:26,692
It smells.

783
01:50:36,131 --> 01:50:37,461
What is that? Noa!

784
01:50:38,461 --> 01:50:39,956
Noa! What happening?

785
01:51:15,262 --> 01:51:17,296
Echo build all this?

786
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:42,296
Wait here.

787
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:36,465
<i>Mama!</i>

788
01:53:50,266 --> 01:53:53,461
The symbols
have meaning.

789
01:54:46,897 --> 01:54:48,296
Time to go.

790
01:55:12,999 --> 01:55:16,362
Whoa. What are they?

791
01:55:17,666 --> 01:55:18,666
Come!

792
01:55:57,625 --> 01:55:59,098
We'll have to move fast.

793
01:55:59,767 --> 01:56:01,294
You go to your clan

794
01:56:01,429 --> 01:56:02,956
and I'll trigger
the explosion.

795
01:56:58,232 --> 01:57:03,329
Noa, you are
a very useful ape.

796
01:57:04,627 --> 01:57:08,666
You understand so many things.

797
01:57:08,801 --> 01:57:11,424
And yet, you fail to observe

798
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:14,692
one of the most important.

799
01:57:16,494 --> 01:57:19,395
You cannot trust a human!

800
01:57:21,035 --> 01:57:24,725
Here comes your clan
to bear witness.

801
01:57:27,998 --> 01:57:30,331
You may be fool enough

802
01:57:30,467 --> 01:57:34,659
to put your faith
in such a duplicitous creature.

803
01:57:37,261 --> 01:57:38,395
But I am not.

804
01:57:46,525 --> 01:57:47,725
Tell me, Noa,

805
01:57:48,567 --> 01:57:50,461
ape to ape,

806
01:57:52,261 --> 01:57:56,857
what did Mae have planned
for me inside my own vault?

807
01:57:59,566 --> 01:58:00,929
Okay.

808
01:58:01,064 --> 01:58:04,159
So what do you choose?

809
01:58:04,295 --> 01:58:07,428
A human over an ape?

810
01:58:08,461 --> 01:58:11,862
Your sweet little Soona...

811
01:58:13,734 --> 01:58:16,092
...or that stinky human?

812
01:58:17,294 --> 01:58:18,494
Tell me your plan!

813
01:58:20,764 --> 01:58:21,824
No!

814
01:58:58,632 --> 01:58:59,956
I see.

815
01:59:02,097 --> 01:59:04,626
You can leave, Mae.

816
01:59:06,161 --> 01:59:07,590
You can go.

817
01:59:07,725 --> 01:59:10,833
You're free. Just tell me...

818
01:59:10,968 --> 01:59:15,659
are there more of those
in there?

819
01:59:22,128 --> 01:59:23,230
Mae?

820
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:25,527
Mae.

821
01:59:27,193 --> 01:59:28,296
No.

822
01:59:29,798 --> 01:59:31,659
We cannot.

823
01:59:32,997 --> 01:59:34,098
He can't have it.

824
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,725
Mae.

825
01:59:37,461 --> 01:59:38,725
- I'm sorry.
- Mae!

826
01:59:40,028 --> 01:59:41,625
No!

827
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:43,956
Mae, no!

828
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:47,362
Mae!

829
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:13,197
What have you done?

830
02:00:19,962 --> 02:00:21,299
Climb.

831
02:00:21,434 --> 02:00:22,434
Climb!

832
02:00:23,393 --> 02:00:24,659
- Climb!
- No.

833
02:00:30,259 --> 02:00:31,259
No!

834
02:01:14,898 --> 02:01:16,625
Noa! Noa!

835
02:01:16,761 --> 02:01:19,092
- Soona!
- Behind you!

836
02:01:19,228 --> 02:01:20,999
Climb!

837
02:01:22,425 --> 02:01:24,095
Son! Son!

838
02:01:24,230 --> 02:01:25,696
- Mother!
- Son!

839
02:01:25,831 --> 02:01:27,657
Mother! Mother!

840
02:01:27,792 --> 02:01:28,872
Mother!

841
02:01:30,458 --> 02:01:31,498
Dar!

842
02:01:31,633 --> 02:01:33,292
Grab her!

843
02:01:33,428 --> 02:01:35,558
Dar! Grab my hand!

844
02:01:35,694 --> 02:01:38,498
- Mother!
- Dar!

845
02:01:41,831 --> 02:01:42,831
Dar!

846
02:01:46,493 --> 02:01:47,824
Dar, got you.

847
02:01:48,963 --> 02:01:50,560
Noa, what we do?

848
02:01:52,592 --> 02:01:54,461
This way! Go!

849
02:02:02,063 --> 02:02:05,161
Eagle Clan! Climb!

850
02:02:05,296 --> 02:02:07,594
Follow Soona! Follow Anaya!

851
02:02:07,729 --> 02:02:10,158
- This way! Climb!
- Go. Go.

852
02:02:10,294 --> 02:02:11,296
Climb!

853
02:02:19,392 --> 02:02:20,461
This way!

854
02:02:22,226 --> 02:02:23,329
Hurry!

855
02:02:25,064 --> 02:02:26,427
Follow Soona!

856
02:02:26,563 --> 02:02:28,461
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Go!

857
02:02:33,197 --> 02:02:35,290
- Come.
- Go!

858
02:02:35,426 --> 02:02:36,523
Climb, Soona!

859
02:02:36,659 --> 02:02:38,197
This the way out!

860
02:02:38,698 --> 02:02:40,126
Hurry!

861
02:02:40,261 --> 02:02:41,290
- Climb!
- Noa!

862
02:02:41,425 --> 02:02:42,558
Mother, go!

863
02:02:42,694 --> 02:02:44,228
- Noa!
- Climb, Anaya!

864
02:02:44,363 --> 02:02:45,696
- Soona, go!
- Lead them!

865
02:02:45,831 --> 02:02:47,323
Go! Climb!

866
02:02:47,459 --> 02:02:50,026
Go! Go, hurry!

867
02:05:34,729 --> 02:05:37,727
You think you can
destroy my kingdom?

868
02:05:47,761 --> 02:05:51,329
You think you can
destroy what I am?

869
02:05:57,165 --> 02:05:58,165
- Noa!
- Leave him.

870
02:06:11,731 --> 02:06:13,131
Noa.

871
02:06:14,801 --> 02:06:18,692
You showed so much promise.

872
02:06:20,464 --> 02:06:23,757
You are going to stand,

873
02:06:23,893 --> 02:06:27,131
so that you can bend
for your king...

874
02:06:27,930 --> 02:06:29,092
before you die.

875
02:06:34,297 --> 02:06:38,331
And you will all bear witness

876
02:06:38,466 --> 02:06:44,324
as Noa bends before his king.

877
02:06:47,633 --> 02:06:48,999
Now stand.

878
02:06:49,963 --> 02:06:51,560
Stand now!

879
02:06:54,633 --> 02:06:55,659
That's it.

880
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:57,890
Clever ape.

881
02:07:21,832 --> 02:07:23,290
What is this?

882
02:07:26,659 --> 02:07:28,459
Trevathan would love this.

883
02:07:58,962 --> 02:07:59,962
Enough!

884
02:08:02,434 --> 02:08:03,434
Enough!

885
02:09:13,326 --> 02:09:17,296
Let us go home.

886
02:09:47,965 --> 02:09:49,127
He's coming!

887
02:09:52,601 --> 02:09:53,725
Soft?

888
02:09:54,458 --> 02:09:56,329
Too firm.

889
02:09:57,161 --> 02:09:58,164
Too firm.

890
02:09:59,932 --> 02:10:01,362
- Silk.
- Good.

891
02:10:07,995 --> 02:10:08,999
Noa.

892
02:10:30,659 --> 02:10:32,296
I came to say goodbye.

893
02:10:41,559 --> 02:10:43,527
Proximus was right.

894
02:10:44,659 --> 02:10:48,461
Humans will never give up.

895
02:10:49,693 --> 02:10:53,663
Not until you claim all things

896
02:10:53,798 --> 02:10:55,329
for yourselves.

897
02:10:56,425 --> 02:10:57,791
It was ours.

898
02:10:58,659 --> 02:11:01,130
That silo was a human place

899
02:11:01,266 --> 02:11:03,061
with human things
and human ideas.

900
02:11:03,197 --> 02:11:04,730
It was not meant for apes.

901
02:11:04,865 --> 02:11:07,494
What is for apes?

902
02:11:09,594 --> 02:11:11,692
Should we go back to silence?

903
02:11:13,692 --> 02:11:16,230
We will rebuild our home.

904
02:11:17,995 --> 02:11:19,164
Better.

905
02:11:19,666 --> 02:11:20,857
Stronger.

906
02:11:21,834 --> 02:11:24,131
From what we have learned.

907
02:11:34,393 --> 02:11:36,626
If Raka were here,

908
02:11:38,098 --> 02:11:40,527
he would tell us his Caesar

909
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:43,932
had much to say on this.

910
02:11:48,294 --> 02:11:50,626
Was he right?

911
02:11:57,034 --> 02:12:02,791
Can ape and human
live together?

912
02:12:13,799 --> 02:12:15,131
I don't know.

913
02:12:29,326 --> 02:12:31,362
Important.

914
02:14:39,434 --> 02:14:40,434
Come.

915
02:14:46,134 --> 02:14:47,929
Rescaling
back down to 20.

916
02:14:48,065 --> 02:14:50,326
New latitude point, 2.722.

917
02:14:50,462 --> 02:14:51,895
Copy that. Spooling up.

918
02:14:52,030 --> 02:14:52,866
Let me know
what that distribution looks like.

919
02:14:52,867 --> 02:14:53,907
Let's get over here.

920
02:14:54,026 --> 02:14:55,376
Readings
have been confirmed.

921
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:57,075
- Link is ready!
- Pulling up now.

922
02:15:42,226 --> 02:15:43,626
Hello.

923
02:15:44,425 --> 02:15:45,826
Is anyone there?

924
02:15:45,962 --> 02:15:47,191
Come on.

925
02:15:47,326 --> 02:15:48,626
Do you hear me?

926
02:15:51,464 --> 02:15:52,925
<i>Yes, hello?</i>

927
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:55,191
<i>This is Fort Wayne, Indiana.
We read you!</i>

928
02:15:56,698 --> 02:15:58,694
<i>It's good to hear
another voice out there.</i>

929
02:15:58,829 --> 02:16:00,692
<i>Tell me where you are.
What's your location?</i>
