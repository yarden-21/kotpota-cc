00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.014
Elder Lerner said,
make your heart still.

00:04:57.026 --> 00:05:00.980
We take them all. No,
never. We've won always.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:14.860
That is the law. Bonding day is tomorrow.
These are yours. You are older.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.640
I think of a sunset. Older.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.300
Suna, which one sings to you?

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.940
So?

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:57.720
We will raise them together.
Like we were raised. It will be the same.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.970
Go, go, go, go.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.580
No.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:15.110
It does not look like you, Anaya.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:19.700
No one's scared.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.720
Not Anaya.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.300
Not Abe.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:03.350
Echo, do not come in from that.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:35.050
It was like a newborn.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.030
Who won?

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:39.550
All must wait before bonding.
Even other teachers.

00:12:40.365 --> 00:12:41.370
I am your mother.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.250
I knew you would climb well.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.300
He waits.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.130
Okay.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.890
Time for that later.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.500
Your father. I want to see.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.910
No.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.200
Yes, Cora.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.720
No.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.270
Suna.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.700
Suna Ego does not like
work for tomorrow's ceremony.

00:15:10.815 --> 00:15:11.815
You climb well.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.900
Above darkness.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.040
All of you?

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.640
No.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.280
Only me.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.910
That smell.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.530
You did not go to the valley beyond.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.430
It's forbidden.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.590
Yet, blood of Echo.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:49.410
Only a blanket.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.850
We did not go to the valley.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.140
Except... You
aren't true, no one.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.290
Much to teach.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.070
After tomorrow's bonding.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.770
Now, elders must know.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.530
Because...

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.900
Only print trouble.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.750
Hold out.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.810
Chase the passes away.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.310
You'll climb the top nest.

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:23.110
Hello.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.260
You see, your father?

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.390
I do not understand, Eagle Sun.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:40.270
I do.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.390
He hates Noah.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.120
No.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:57.530
With elders... they send
Hoda to scare Echo away.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:05.230
When Mother was small,
dry seas in Shrank Creek.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.770
Echo arranged for food.

00:18:09.385 --> 00:18:11.870
She saw a small and a big.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.550
We have good faith.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:18.590
Our wives.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.330
Our bonding is at sunrise.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.110
Master, all birds will make exception.

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.690
They will not make
him wait for next season.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:13.930
Yes, he will.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.710
He is your father.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.710
Then I am his son.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.510
Then I will wait for you.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.390
Naya, wait too.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:32.490
You cannot.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:30.850
Noah.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:32.450
Hoda.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:10.570
Over the horse!

00:25:10.571 --> 00:25:12.050
Find his clown!

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:00.490
For Caesar!

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:02.870
For Caesar!

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.070
Take them to Procterus.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:10.610
Find the human!

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.090
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.690
No, for your life.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:56.690
No.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.970
I will find them.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.690
I will bring them home.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:27.970
Come to me.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.460
No.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.870
How young you are.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.060
Without this.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.340
Speak up.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.640
Speak.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:50.780
Up.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:52.460
Not mine.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.280
Them.

00:40:02.465 --> 00:40:03.580
Explain yourself.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.120
Thank you, my father.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.020
Stoned my village.

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:13.980
I follow their tracks.

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:28.350
He was my village.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.570
He killed him.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.840
I am Raka.

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:19.980
He was outside when they arrived.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.960
Did you see my clan?

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.840
No.

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:26.490
I hid.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.880
I survived.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.440
I protected our work.

00:41:43.275 --> 00:41:48.440
They are an ancient way to store ideas.

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.980
The symbols have meaning.

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.780
Apes understood this meaning.

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:05.400
In the time of Caesar.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:14.860
The masks in my village said that name.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.100
Caesar.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.600
Shameful.

00:42:21.975 --> 00:42:24.100
The masks take his name.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:26.780
Twist his words.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:29.460
Who is he? Not his.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.460
Once.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.700
Your clan does not know the true Caesar.

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:43.840
Too many have forgotten.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:48.570
I know.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:51.510
Elders of my village, they made the law.

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:53.450
That is everything.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:57.310
That is not everything.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:04.990
Long before your elders, it was Caesar
who taught us what it means to be.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:05.750
Ape.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.530
He was our leader, our law-giver.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.890
Apes, together, strong.

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:14.850
Ape shall not kill.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.610
Ape.

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:21.770
We, the Order of Caesar,
follow his words to this day.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.770
I follow.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:30.110
I am now the last.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.600
Continuous.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.920
What is this place?

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:46.840
We believe Apes built
this as a refuge for humans.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:54.940
Now it is rare to see even one but in
Caesar's time there were vast herds of them.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:56.820
Can you imagine?

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.880
Perhaps here humans were cared for.

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:05.640
Then maybe even taught.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:14.550
What is it?

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:26.820
You have seen one?

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.500
One.

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:32.260
They are scavengers.

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:36.220
Like boars, only lesser.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:43.400
Humans are slow-witted
but there was a time.

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:48.100
When humans and apes lived side by side.

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:55.660
Yes, it is a puzzle, I know.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.600
But they were important to Caesar.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:05.700
So they are important to me.

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:11.770
I have to get to my horse.

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:14.390
Of course.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:15.970
Follow me.

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:21.990
You do not know Caesar.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.850
You do not know books.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:31.450
You should stay here.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:37.950
There is much I could teach you.

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:43.460
Go away!

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.140
No! Come back!

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:45.760
Pass!

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.360
Wait!

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.600
Come back!

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.220
There is so!

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:51.820
Danger!

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.520
That is the one.

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:56.740
So from my village.

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:01.820
She follows you from your village.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.600
Perhaps Caesar bids me travel.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.980
Wait here.

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.760
Work continues.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.720
I have no time for it.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:19.800
I will not slow you down.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.300
I too keep it worse.

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:31.020
Can we not slow you down?

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.620
No.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.280
I am sure she follows.

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:39.060
I do not know why.

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.140
A beautiful bird.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.620
Eagle's son.

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.140
My father's bird.

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.500
He follows to taunt me.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:01.300
This bird follows you too?

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:04.140
We raise eagles.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:05.960
My clan.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:07.780
Sing to them.

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:09.670
So they know us.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.240
A bond.

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:14.420
Sing the song.

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:16.540
Please.

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:20.860
No.

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:24.900
My father was master of birds.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:26.180
He sang two eagles.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.760
But I am not him.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.520
Shame.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.580
I would have enjoyed a song.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:00.710
Strange weapons.

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:03.370
Broken.

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:35.920
Raba.

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:41.090
Noah.

00:48:41.091 --> 00:48:42.091
Noah.

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:07.020
This is important.

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:11.000
They get cold.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:15.780
Show mercy.

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:39.580
She is smarter than most.

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:48.080
We will name her Nova.

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:53.420
We name them all Nova.

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:57.540
I do not know why it is from Caesar's time.

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:02.780
Why did Caesar care so much for echos?

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:08.400
Legend says he was reared by them.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.100
Impossible as that may seem.

00:50:13.275 --> 00:50:15.800
Caesar Legend is important.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.140
He was first elder.

00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:23.860
He led with decency.

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.020
Morality.

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.420
Strength.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:45.570
Caesar never had to
share camp with this Nova.

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:50.610
Oh!

00:50:57.830 --> 00:50:59.620
The smell is potent.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:54.210
A tunnel that eats light.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.000
She saw what I saw.

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:00.530
It was in her eyes.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.660
She reacted.

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.220
How? As April would.

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:20.510
If Echo comes, she must ride.

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:25.410
Is my young companion showing compassion
for our fellow traveler? She is slow.

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:27.850
Horse.

00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:59.050
Also there is the gibbet.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.830
Very, very long arms.

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:08.190
The most unfortunate that the
human can only use its feet for walking.

00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:11.270
Imagine if you were falling from a tree.

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.570
You only have two
appendages to save your life.

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:19.430
But if you were able to use both
of your hands and both of your feet,

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:21.990
that's four times the safety.

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:26.990
And I imagine that if I
came across a special...

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:31.190
What is that?

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:29.380
Horses with strikes.

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.980
Quite striking.

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:25.550
We fear the hurt ceased to exist.

00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:50.400
Will you not say goodbye?

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.200
I must find my clan.

00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:00.740
The Nova stays with her kind.

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:03.400
You raise them up.

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:08.000
Follow Caesar's word.

00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:22.280
To remember who he was.

00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:27.600
It is important.

00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:59.240
They are like you.

00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:03.100
Would you like to
join them? He has his.

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:27.260
.. come.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:35.880
Oh, she's here.

01:03:58.330 --> 01:03:59.330
Parker!

01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:29.580
This should give us...

01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:08.100
What did I miss? She spoke.

01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:14.950
She called my name.

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.260
You misheard.

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:22.440
You said this, Nova, was smarter than most.

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:28.040
With a reason, some
intelligence to be sure.

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:29.140
I have a name.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.120
Meg.

01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:38.411
I know where they're taking your clan.

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:49.180
It's a human settlement.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.441
That's what I'm headed to.

01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:54.710
Looking for more like me.

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:56.420
There are more.

01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:58.700
Like you.

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:02.490
There used to be more.

01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:05.960
You hid the truth.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.540
Your mother taught me silence.

01:06:10.645 --> 01:06:11.645
For my safety.

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:15.340
You were safe with us.

01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:18.680
And still not true.

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.300
Where is your mother?

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.100
Now.

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:26.730
I am alone.

01:06:32.090 --> 01:06:33.450
As are we.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:36.580
But now.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.500
We have each other.

01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:55.800
Those have a fire.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.620
We have much to discuss.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:55.720
Vonnegut.

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.720
That's a good one.

01:16:59.830 --> 01:17:01.340
Not a lot of fiction there.

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:04.860
I'm just mostly interested in history.

01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:08.940
Roman history, especially.

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:15.580
My name is Trevathan.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.180
Where are you from? You first.

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:32.300
Well, it doesn't really
matter, does it? I left.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:33.960
Same as you.

01:17:37.530 --> 01:17:39.660
Made it almost to the coast.

01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:42.480
And then I fell and shattered my ankles.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.580
That's where Proxima's found me.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:50.380
And now you read him Roman history.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:55.620
So, who are you?

01:17:57.730 --> 01:17:59.640
I'm the human not helping the apes.

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:17.460
Noah! We must go.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.120
Say his words.

01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:45.380
Say his words! That felt good.

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:04.440
When I think of those
words, I feel good.

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:22.040
The Caesar requires stronger tomorrow.

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:45.500
Whoever's in there is either dead or gone.

01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:50.160
We've been banging on that door for months.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.460
Do you not know where we are?

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:58.200
When things got bad and the
government went underground,

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.520
this is where half of it went.

01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:03.800
With all their technology
and all their weapons.

01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:07.530
Don't you understand?

01:24:08.845 --> 01:24:11.320
That ape cannot have what is inside.

01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:13.960
You gotta stop thinking
about the way things were.

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.920
And start thinking about the way they are.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.680
This is a good life.

01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:21.220
And you have a chance to be a part of it.

01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:23.620
What a build a world for the apes.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.880
It is already their world.

01:24:35.130 --> 01:24:37.780
There's hot water and fresh
clothes in that room back there.

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:42.180
You feel better when you
get yourself cleaned up.

01:24:44.025 --> 01:24:46.260
Better figure out how to
be useful or I'll be good.

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:56.520
That's a fact.

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.260
We had no choice.

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:08.040
You must accept it is law.

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:17.000
The elders did not tell us
everything about this world.

01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:22.160
They did not tell us
because they did not know.

01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:26.540
They did not want to know.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.200
You are different.

01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:38.970
Go.

01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:56.620
That's what we all want to talk about.

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:12.000
Hey, come. Come sit.

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:15.380
Please.

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.730
Wonderful day.

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:40.110
Yes? You two have
come a long way.

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:45.250
A night from the human traveling together.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:48.430
Quite an adventure.

01:26:51.650 --> 01:26:55.430
You are Noah, yes. Welcome, Noah.

01:27:10.605 --> 01:27:11.605
Go.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:26.290
May, you are familiar with
the concept of evolution.

01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:28.870
That is, the human label.

01:27:28.871 --> 01:27:33.410
The advancement that I crave requires time.

01:27:34.410 --> 01:27:38.010
The vast amounts of
time that I do not have.

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:42.610
Unfortunately, I am but a mortal ape.

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:49.290
So this is why I need to give
the knowledge inside that vote.

01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:53.670
I believe it will deliver
instant evolution.

01:27:54.670 --> 01:27:55.910
No.

01:27:58.750 --> 01:27:59.750
You don't understand.

01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:07.410
In their time, humans were
capable of many great things.

01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:11.130
They could level mountains.

01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:15.170
They could speak cross oceans.

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:19.750
They could fly Noah like eagles fly.

01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:22.950
But now we will learn.

01:28:23.670 --> 01:28:26.810
Apes will learn. I will learn.

01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:29.490
From what is inside that vault.

01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:32.430
It's impossible.

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.030
No one's getting in there.

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:43.330
May, may, may, may.

01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:49.270
My apes encountered law.

01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:51.020
Companions.

01:28:52.110 --> 01:28:55.050
I believe this map will belong to you.

01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:57.030
You see, Noah.

01:28:57.770 --> 01:29:00.490
Before she was travelling with you.

01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:07.210
And then over the reign of 10
men was with other humans.

01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:16.720
But sadly, my apes did
not realize their value.

01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:20.640
So I was brought only bodies.

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:25.900
I could not speak to them
like I can speak to you.

01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:33.640
I know you are coming
here to get inside my vault.

01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:34.930
It is not yours!

01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:39.240
All it is now, isn't it?

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:42.120
And I will get inside.

01:29:42.121 --> 01:29:47.760
No matter how many apes it costs me.

01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:56.260
And Noah, I have heard that
you are a very clever ape young.

01:29:57.730 --> 01:30:02.540
Very clever. He repaired one
of your broken staffs traditionally.

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:04.560
Yeah.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:08.600
I have much use for clever apes.

01:30:09.785 --> 01:30:17.360
Now, can you tell me that may
tell you how to get inside my vault?

01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:24.210
She told me nothing.

01:30:25.130 --> 01:30:26.190
Oh, don't do that.

01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:28.030
No.

01:30:31.795 --> 01:30:32.795
Don't do nothing.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.510
Noah, come with me.

01:30:41.511 --> 01:30:42.511
Come, come.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.390
I am so going to show you.

01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:48.230
Come, come.

01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:51.410
Come.

01:30:53.370 --> 01:30:55.670
Tell me, what do you see?

01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:29.900
Where there are two that can speak.

01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:31.960
There must be more.

01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:39.470
Inside my vault.

01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:45.090
Them dangerous.

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:49.410
That is why I must have them first.

01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:58.710
This is my kingdom.

01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:21.160
Noah, let us eat.

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:23.920
Traitor.

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:52.350
They will not come.

01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:04.060
Because eagle clan is gone.

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:09.460
Eagle clan...

01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:11.660
Is he here? We are here.

01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:20.040
A land of Proxima.

01:33:22.110 --> 01:33:26.720
And Proxima has no need for eagles.

01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:11.220
I judge myself.

01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:47.640
Time for the evening lesson.

01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.720
It would be very good for you to be there.

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:31.790
You did not come for echos.

01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:36.510
And you were not alone.

01:36:38.050 --> 01:36:39.050
I'm sorry.

01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:43.530
Proxima is his ape's founder again.

01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:47.590
They killed everyone.

01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:51.391
I barely... I have escaped.

01:36:52.570 --> 01:36:53.630
I needed your help.

01:36:55.170 --> 01:36:59.130
And I was afraid... The more
you speak, the less I believe.

01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:01.490
I was wrong not to trust you.

01:37:02.250 --> 01:37:03.050
And I know that now.

01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:05.770
I trust you only to help yourself.

01:37:08.665 --> 01:37:10.650
But that could help me now.

01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:15.960
I have questions.

01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:18.860
You answer true.

01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:21.260
Maybe I help.

01:37:24.785 --> 01:37:26.960
What do you need inside the boat?

01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:32.040
It's like a book.

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:34.500
A special book.

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:37.280
Special?

01:37:38.850 --> 01:37:40.620
Humans lost their ability to speak.

01:37:41.650 --> 01:37:43.011
And this book might bring it back.

01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:46.120
A book can do
this? This one can.

01:37:56.100 --> 01:38:03.800
Gracchus and apes and
humans lived side by side.

01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:07.110
True or not true?

01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:11.580
Apes were silent.

01:38:13.150 --> 01:38:14.160
Like the echo.

01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:17.180
Humans were dominant.

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:20.120
The virus spread.

01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.990
That we created.

01:38:24.190 --> 01:38:25.240
It made apes smarter.

01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:28.600
And it almost killed all of us.

01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:37.010
You know a way inside?

01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:39.030
Yes.

01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:41.010
Yes.

01:38:42.230 --> 01:38:43.590
And last question.

01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:51.270
Will water destroy
what is inside? A climb.

01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:30.700
One I cannot do alone.

01:40:36.610 --> 01:40:37.610
This is me.

01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:40.950
Hello, Sinan.

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:46.160
What do we do?

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.780
We're gonna need all of this.

01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:52.100
Follow me.

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:11.560
The power runs through.

01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:35.760
You cannot make a hard climb.

01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:40.260
Without a knife.

01:42:12.810 --> 01:42:13.810
This burns hot.

01:42:14.450 --> 01:42:18.920
But under...explode.

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.240
Oh, shit.

01:42:41.730 --> 01:42:43.210
Save her that way.

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:51.680
You like her.

01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:55.500
Sinan.

01:42:57.340 --> 01:42:59.140
We were born with him for some sense.

01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:05.460
He's just going to rebuild it.

01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:21.740
You had an opportunity.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.340
I gave you an opportunity.

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:30.060
But you're fantasizing about a
past that can never come back.

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:37.520
Listen to me.

01:43:38.770 --> 01:43:46.770
You think it's over.

01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:53.940
Nobody is going to blame
you for what happened here.

01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.500
Just... come with us.

01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:02.660
Please.

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:12.220
He's going to skin your monkey alive.

01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:22.981
And you... you're
going to learn.

01:48:59.290 --> 01:49:00.430
No, no, no.

01:52:46.145 --> 01:52:49.271
The symbols... have meaning.

01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:43.110
Time to go.

01:55:58.170 --> 01:56:01.770
Understand so many things.

01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:03.750
Please.

01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:27.720
You shall tell me the
place of this creature.

01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:31.520
But I am not.

01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:08.940
But I'm stinking of human.

01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:11.540
Clear me up, I am! No! I see.

01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:14.240
You can leave.

01:57:43.690 --> 01:57:51.690
You can go.

01:57:53.850 --> 01:57:55.430
For free.

01:57:58.110 --> 01:57:59.270
More of those.

01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:05.680
..

01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:08.820
in there.

01:58:25.130 --> 01:58:26.260
I can't have it.

01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:27.680
Lay.

01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:29.900
I'm sorry.

01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:31.300
Lay!

01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:32.520
You!

01:58:32.521 --> 01:58:33.521
No!

02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:07.920
So... so... what
you promised me...

02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:36.400
Now stand.

02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:38.900
Stand now! That's it.

02:05:42.370 --> 02:05:43.420
Never end.

02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:10.940
What is this?

02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:16.020
A baked-in macrossfish.

02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:32.880
What is this?

02:06:35.710 --> 02:06:36.710
Ah!

02:09:30.250 --> 02:09:33.650
Humans will never give up.

02:09:35.150 --> 02:09:38.450
Not until you claim all things...

02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:40.430
for yourselves.

02:09:41.770 --> 02:09:42.770
It was ours.

02:09:44.290 --> 02:09:45.890
That silo was a human place.

02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:48.450
With human things and human ideas,

02:09:48.610 --> 02:09:50.090
it was not meant for apes.

02:09:50.210 --> 02:09:52.470
What is for apes?

02:09:54.810 --> 02:09:56.710
Should we go back to silence?

02:09:59.030 --> 02:10:01.710
We will rebuild our home.

02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:03.950
Better.

02:10:05.250 --> 02:10:06.250
Stronger.

02:10:06.990 --> 02:10:08.310
From what we have learned.

02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:21.690
If Raka were here...

02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:25.690
he would tell us his Caesar...

02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:27.710
had much to say on this.

02:10:33.010 --> 02:10:34.970
Was he right? And ape.

02:10:41.570 --> 02:10:43.570
..

02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:46.390
and human...

02:10:46.690 --> 02:10:48.930
live together...

02:11:14.580 --> 02:11:15.580
important.
